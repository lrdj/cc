This repo contains memories uploaded to https://www.columbia.edu/cu/alumni/connection/connect/s1_3a.html

The site was created by Ian Kilby (ian.kilby@thethingthatiwant.com) and is run by universtiy alumni volunteers.

The purpose of the repo is to preserve the memories and make them easier to browse.

Other users, volunteers or archivists are welcome to download the memories stored in flat files in a structured data format. Link here (last update 20 April 2025): (path TBD)/CU-memory-archive.zip
