# Succinct as Could Be

During freshman week we attended several lectures.  The one that stayed with me and which I passed on to my children (Michele '86C, Benjamin '91C) is that of the late Harry Coleman.

He said to us, "This is your last chance to get a superior liberal arts education.  Make the most of it!"
