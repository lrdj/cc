# When Fruit Fly Genetics Only Cost a Nickel

Though I could not attend the Columbia 250th Anniversary celebration, I do want to express my appreciation for all that Columbia has meant to me over the years.  In 1936-7 I was a graduate student in the Zoology Department.  I had received a Grant-in-Aid of $75 covering all tuition costs!  Since I commuted from home in New Jersey, bus and subway (a nickel a ride!) fares, books and lab fees were my only costs.   It was at the time when Columbia was carrying on its famous genetic research on fruit flies, and my genetics course with the wonderful Professor Edmund Sinnot (who went on to head Yale's Graduate School) brought all of us involvement in understanding fruit fly heredity.  I met one of my dearest friends in that class, and, with the M.A. earned, went on to teach at Simmons College.  I have been especially happy with Columbia's involvement with CERC.
