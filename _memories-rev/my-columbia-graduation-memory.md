# Graduation Memory

After my ceremony, we went somewhere to get the envelope with our diplomas.  When I opened mine, there was no diploma, only a bill for a library fine.  For a book I had returned and for which I had paid the fine!  My parents paid the fine again so we could go home with a diploma.
