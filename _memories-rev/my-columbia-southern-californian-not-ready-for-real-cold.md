# Southern Californian Not Ready for Real Cold

My reaction to the first cold days I experienced in Morningside Heights were a little like Dorothy's initial response to being in Oz: "I don't think we're in Kansas anymore."

In fact, I didn't have to wait until actual winter to have abundant visceral proof that I was in a place unlike sunny San Diego, where I had spent my childhood.

In Fall 1958, I immediately fell into a behavioral trap awaiting a Southern Californian used to a mild climate most of the year. I merely looked out my Livingston Hall dorm window: if it the sun was shinning, that meant -- by San Diego standards -- that I didn't even need a coat that day, especially since most of my classes were in nearby Hamilton Hall.

I should have recognized the new reality the first morning I stepped out onto the chilly Quad. It took three mornings of deep chills to prompt me to try a different approach.

Friday afternoon, I bought a ÃÂ¾-length loden coat with fiberglass lining. It had a tall turn-up collar, was large enough to go over a sports jacket and sweater. I usually wore it with a good wool scarf. This outfit got me through Thanksgiving. After that, for the remainder of my years at Columbia, I usually wore hooded sweat shirts with my loden coat, and on the really cold Winter and later Spring days, IÃ¢â¬â¢d have wool pajamas on under my regular clothes.

The changes in the seasons had caught me by surprise. But I found Columbia and New York City warm in all other ways.
