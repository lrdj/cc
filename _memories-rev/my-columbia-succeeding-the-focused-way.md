# Succeeding the Focused Way

When I was an undergraduate in occupational therapy, part of our classes were at the medical center and part at Teachers College. I lived on the main campus.  I found that returning to college after a break of working for a year to gain funds was a real challenge for me.

Inevitably, I would find that going to the medical library on 168th St. and going to the Teachers College library wound up being very distracting.  I used to say that I learned a lot by reading all kinds of stuff, not very much of it related to why I went to the library -- to study or research something.

I finally found the perfect solution -- the Law Library.  I loved the copy of Rodin's statue in front of the building, but the real reason it enabled my success is that there was utterly nothing in the entire library that I was remotely interested in reading.  I thus was able to stay focused on my goal: to complete my studies and absorb the material on which I would be tested.  Interestingly enough, I also did not find the young men who labored there for their own courses the least bit interesting or attractive.  I do think it provided me the perfect learning environment for staying focused on my work and for succeeding brilliantly.  So brilliantly, in fact, that I later returned as a faculty member for the same program from which I graduated (occupational therapy).
