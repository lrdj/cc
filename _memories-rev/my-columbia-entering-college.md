# Entering College

I was a graduate of Lafayette H. S. in Brooklyn, N. Y. in 1942.  World War ll had started, and I enlisted in the Army Air Corps as an Aviation Cadet. After flying as a Bombardier with the 8th Air Force in 35 combat missions over Germany, I returned to "civilian life" in October 1945.

During orientation week, I learned that I was the only entrant to Columbia College from a New York City high school. That scared me. All the other guys seemed to come from famous prep schools around the country. I thought that I wanted to become an "International Lawyer," and go to the Hague to put a stop to all wars. I soon changed my mind and signed up to go to Dental School. Our first year's classes were the same as those of the pre-medical students. I soon found out that I was able to compete with all my classmates academically. I had made the Dean's List. My grade adviser was Dr. Charles Dawson, the head of the Organic Chemistry Department.  Dr. Dawson and I had a conference in which he convinced me to change my major to Pre-Medicine, which I did.

In my opinion, Dr. Dawson not only changed my upcoming career, but positively altered my life.

My academic and athletic accomplishments were good enough for me to enter the Columbia College of Physicians & Surgeons. From my point of view, the medical education at P & S was superior, and I consider the medical school to be among the best in the world.
