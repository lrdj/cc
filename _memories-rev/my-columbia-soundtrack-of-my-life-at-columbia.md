# Soundtrack of My Life at Columbia

The soundtrack of my Columbia experience was definitely country music, which is strange considering NYC doesn't have a single 24-hour country music radio station.  As an intern and then host of the 40s and 50s country music broadcast Honky-Tonkin', I listened to Hank every Tuesday night.
