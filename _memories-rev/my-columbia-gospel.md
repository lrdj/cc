# Gospel!

During the winter and spring, numerous students and parents packed Altschul Auditorium in SIPA to hear the joyous and triumphant sounds of the Barnard-Columbia Gospel Choir.  Some of my fondest memories of Columbia are of directing the choir with my best friend Traci Turner Wilkerson (Barnard '90).
