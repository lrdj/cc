# My "Artsy" Experience

In my 7 years at Columbia, my "artsy" experience both on and off campus was significant. On campus, I had a memorable classes in art history, music and in Shakespeare. I also took a class in textile design at Teacher's College.

In addition, one night in Spring '68, there was an awesome band that played in the old Ferris Booth Hall auditorium. Off campus, I attended the Joffrey Ballet, the Lincoln Philharmonic, and various stage plays. I also visited most of the major NYC art museums (Metropolitan, Modern Art, Frick, Guggenheim, Cloisters, etc.) and numerous art galleries in the village. I participated in workshops at the International Center of Photography, and photographed in the city. My most memorable experience -- good question -- probably some of the great performances of the Joffrey Ballet.

Best regards,
