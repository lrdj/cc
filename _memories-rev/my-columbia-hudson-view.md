# Hudson View

After transferring from a school with cinderblock housing, metal bunk beds, and views of the nothingness of the middle of Indiana, I found myself in an end room of Maxwell Hall overlooking the Hudson. It was 1971. Not only did I have beautiful wooden moldings, a terrific view of the George Washington Bridge, but also maid service to clean my room and change my sheets.
