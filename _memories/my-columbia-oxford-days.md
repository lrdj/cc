# Oxford Days

I had a wonderful oportunity to take part in an Oxford summer study program while a junior at Columbia. Studying along with British and other American students in such a classic setting was memorable.  I rememebr with great fondness the impromtu barbecue and Independence Day party that a few of us had there, to the dismay of some of the more traditional Brits!
