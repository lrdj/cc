# Ski Jump on Low Steps

After a once-in-a-decade snowstorm in the heart of New York, my teammates and I decided (brilliantly, I might add) to venture with our ski gear out to the Low library steps. After all, we weren't at practice that day. We spent about an hour digging through the two feet of fresh snow that had blanketed campus to create a massive kicker (jump) on the landing between the two sets of the Low library steps, off to the side of our friend Alma Mater. It was not, however, until we'd finished the lead ramp and stood at its top that the respectable men and women of the Columbia Security patrol decided to question our motives. After all, they didn't seem to have a problem with the stolen-John-Jay-dining-tray sledders who were using the same steps. After a brief discussion, I managed to convince them that, as Columbia Club Sport athletes we had signed a waiver giving us full responsibility for our actions with respect to the University. While its original intent was for slope-side activity, it seemed to satisfy them. We had a wonderful afternoon playing in the day off, staying warm even in the middle of one of the coldest afternoons I've ever spent on campus. My good friend Alex Williams-Resnick is pictured here.
