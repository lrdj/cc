# Forging Friendships on the Road to Columbia

Being a part-time graduate student from the business community in New Jersey, my Columbia "social life" consisted of long, afternoon commutes into the city and  somewhat shorter drives back home. The many hours spent with my fellow car-poolers - Amy and Liz - provided more than enough time to learn about their  family histories, work woes and, occasionally, our Columbia courses.

After the first semester of commuting, we discovered that a friendly smile and conversation with the garage attendant would allow us early access to staff parking underneath Mudd Hall. With the knowledge of a guaranteed parking spot, we could plan on the extra time for grabbing a quick meal, further forging our friendship.

Upon graduation, we kept in touch over lunches near our office locations and eventually in play groups with our first children. Over time, we moved away from the area but stayed connected through letters and e-mail. This year, as two of the early playmates (both girls) are beginning their college search, we've had fun comparing notes via e-mail on the various colleges and majors being considered. Who knows - maybe they'll end up roomates at Columbia?
