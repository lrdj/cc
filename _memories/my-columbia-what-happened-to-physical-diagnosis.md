# What Happened to Physical Diagnosis

I have been retired for ten years. As do most of my contemporaries, I have had a variety of ailments.  I am struck by the almost universal cursoriness of physical examinations by today's physicians. The reliance is almost totally on tests: MRIs, etc., etc.

In this regard, I am reminded of one of the best teachers in my memory: Yale Kneeland, a Professor of Medicine at P&S. One remembers not only his skill in imparting the facts of Physical Diagnosis but also his wit and urbanity.

As an aside, an equally skilled mentor was his sister, Virginia Kneeland Frantz. It must have been a congenital ability.
