# Campus Spirituality?

To be honest, at that point in my life, spirituality was not on my agenda. I have examined it later on.  I would say though that learning about and therefore becoming comfortable with my family's cultural, and religious background (having been born and raised in the western hemisphere) was something that I pursued during college. This endeavor I acomplished directly through my choice of major studies and therefore Columbia directly really helped me with that.
