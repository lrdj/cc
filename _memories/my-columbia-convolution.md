# Convolution

I was introduced to the mathematical operation of "convolution" as an aspiring EE (Electrical Engineering) student in an Electromagenetics course taught by a professor already named in these archives by someone else. Now, I wanted to be a "practicing/practical" engineer and not a theoretician, so I went to the prof. and asked him what the physical manifestation of "convolution" might be.  His reply was, "Beats me.  I'm seconded from the Math department.  It's just numbers to me."  This flabbergasted me.

One thing led to another, and I ended up in CS (Computer Science; or, as piece of graffiti I once spotted on a carrel in the SEAS library stated mathematically: "As the topics of study progress to the infinitely arcane, EE undergrads become CS undergrads").  At CS, I took an Image Manipulation and Warping course taught by a then-aspiring Ph.D. student named George Wolberg, and, in this course, I slammed head first into "convolution" yet again.  I thought my technical career was over; if a full professor couldn't explain the physical manifestation of "convolution," what was the possibility that a mere Ph.D. student could do better?

Nevertheless, I doggedly pursued my quest by asking him the same question I had asked of that EM prof, expecting another bout of smoke and mirror explanations that left me no closer to understanding. To my utter amazement, he not only provided me with a crystal-clear explanation of what convolution was and its applications to the topic at hand, but he also provided an explanation that applied in both 2D and 3D space, with a hint of how it could extend even further dimensionally.  And he did it in 15 minutes flat!!!  I couldn't believe it was so mind-bogglingly simple.  The light went on in my head so brightly I think I blinded myself.

In that instant of mental enlightenment, I also came to realize that if someone can explain his (possibly arcane) speciality in language that a layman or beginner can grasp, without sacrificing too much of the nuances, then he is a true master of his field.  To this day, I have a great degree of respect for Professor Wolberg's teaching abilities that no other teacher I've known to date even comes close to earning.  I only hope that his current institution(s) (whatever they may be) value his abilities as much.
