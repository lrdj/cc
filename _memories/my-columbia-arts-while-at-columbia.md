# Arts While at Columbia

A long time ago, the physical therapy degree program was all-consuming, with classes at 168th Street and internships all over NYC, but I found a few hours, once in a while, to enjoy the arts in NY. My very favorite place was the Frick Museum on Fifth Avenue. I would often take some required reading and sit in the cool, peaceful central garden to finish an assignment or merely wander the many rooms filled with magnificent art works.  Vermeer was the favorite master for me. I don't remember an entrance fee that was exorbitant, as I was on a very tight budget and it was in the years between 1956 and 1958.  The most memorable times were in the spring, when the weather was warming up and new growth could be felt within the city there at the Frick.  I shall always be grateful for that oasis in the city.
