# The Teacher Who Changed My Life

It was unlikely that I, a solidly pre-medical student from a solidly medical family (father was P&S '00) would be impressed by a distinguished professor of philosophy.  Yet it was James Gutmann who introduced this little kid (youngest in the class) to thought for its own sake and particularly to Plato and Saint Paul.  Gutmann, although he knew I was committed to medicine, perhaps because he knew that, made sure that a thinking person, introduced to the great philosophers, would be a better scientist.

Until his death at over 90, Gutmann kept track of me and my career.  We became good friends and both enjoyed Martha's Vineyard in the summer.  He was interested in my medical research as I was interested in his Platonic answers to the questions that have no single answer.  He made me a better physician and a whole person.
