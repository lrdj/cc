# Experiences of Religion at Columbia -- Fond Memories of Paul Dinter

I imagine anyone who had the opportunity to be part of the Catholic community at Xavier while Fr. Paul Dinter was the Catholic chaplain will remember that time fondly, as I do.  Paul was my first exposure to an "intellectual" Catholicism, one that challenged me to see faith and religion in broader historical and societal contexts.  And one that helped me to understand that belief can coexist with questioning.  Even at some fundamental level, Paul showed me that smart people can be religious, too, which was an important lesson during college, when I was trying to determine the adult version of my childhood faith.  Paul left Columbia after my junior year and the void was tremendous.  And since college, when I haved joined congregations, I have looked for the same intellectual challenge from the parish leadership.  He's a difficult act to follow -- and I will always be grateful for the role he played in my own growth.
