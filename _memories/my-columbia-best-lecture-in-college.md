# Best Lecture in College

Willard Gaylin, a psychiatrist and adjunct professor, taught a class on Freud in the early 70s. Gaylin was animated, brilliant, accessible, and captivated a huge room full of students for two hours a week. I usually left wishing the class was longer and more frequent, and I ultimately approached Gaylin and did an independent study with him in my senior year.

His power as a teacher, his ability to connect with people and to command the podium for a long period of time, stayed with me and made me realize how good a professor could be, and how appealing public speaking could be.
