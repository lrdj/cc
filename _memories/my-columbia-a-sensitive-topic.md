# A Sensitive Topic

While studying anthropology at Columbia University I learned to think.

In the late 1960's remarkable human beings such as Joan Vincent, Abraham Rosman, Marvin Harris, Margaret Mead, and other smart, bold, kind, and devoted men and women nurtured the seeds of my own intellectual, ethical, theological and spiritual development.

I have come to appreciate this creative interaction of people, ideas, and passion as a miraculous gift. In my lifetime I try to contribute to its continuity as a parent, citizen, religious community member, and professional.

How utterly surprising, then, to become drawn into the intriguing question of religious life experience at Columbia, only to be confronted by the uninviting, unintelligent offering of "vaguely Christian but basically non-denominational Columbia tree ornaments." Yikes!

Can it be that only vague Christians need respond? Or that ethnocentricity is alarmingly present in a well-intentioned bulletin "for all alumni of Columbia University"? Some (many) of us Columbia alumni are neither vague, nor Christian, nor do we collect these particular artifacts.

Our stories on the "sensitive topic" may remain unwritten because of such disheartening insensitivity.

Nevertheless,thank you for the question and the opportunity to reflect. Alison Jordan

Editor's Note: The Columbia tree ornaments were offered in the University alumni newsletter of October 26, 2005.
