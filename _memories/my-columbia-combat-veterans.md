# Combat Veterans

I entered Columbia College in 1946 along with many combat veterans of World War II. I was 22 years old and one of the youngest veterans in my class. I had flown missions over Germany in B-17's with the 8th Air Force from September 1944 to March 1945. Alongside me were veterans from Iwo Gima, Guadacanal, and many other Pacific battles. There were also veterans from North Africa and the Italian campaign, plus many form the Navy.

We set the highest academic scores in the history of Columbia. That was due to the fact that we were very serious about making up for "lost time." Most of us went to summer sessions carrying at least 13 credits.

My most memorable teacher was Dr. Charles Dawson, Professor of Organic Chemistry. He was very influential in changing my major studies to medicine. Dr. Dawson was one of the most organized and fair teachers I ever met.

Another great teacher was Professor Casey in Sociology. There was always "standing room only" when he gave his lectures.

After all these years after graduation (56 years), these two fabulous teachers remain close to my heart.
