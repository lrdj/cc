# Religion at Columbia

I was a graduate student in sociology in the 1960's.  My wife and I, both white, lived in Woodbridge Hall at 115th and Riverside. Before we met, she had joined Church of the Master, a largely African-American Presbyterian congregation at 122nd and Morningside Avenue, just east of Morningside Park.  When we began to date, I also joined this exciting church, whose pastor, Dr. James Robinson, was the founder of Crossroads Africa, the predecessor of the Peace Corps.  I went with the delegation from Church of the Master to the 1963 March on Washington and heard King's "I Have a Dream" speech.  I was the alternate delegate from the church to the Morningside Renewal Council, an area civic association.  In the rollcall votes, Church of the Master immediately preceded Columbia University.  Representing the interests of the African-American residents of the west Harlem area, I cast our church's "no" vote on a critical neighborhood issue just before Columbia, which had development plans for Morningside Park, voted "yes."   While writing a doctoral dissertation on Black politics in New York City, I was a sociology instructor at Brooklyn College.  After teaching at Grinnell College in Iowa, I attended theological seminary and became a Presbyterian minister.  I am still very committed to civil rights and the battle against poverty.  Working with largely white congregations, I endeavor to foster the spirit of deep spirituality and passion for social justice that Ruth and I found at Church of the Master.
