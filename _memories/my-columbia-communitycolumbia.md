# Community/Columbia

Amidst graduate seminars at the Casa Hispanica, Teachers College, and SIPA, I worked at Community Impact's adult education program where I supervised Columbia volunteers in ESL classes in Washington Heights, taught ESL and Spanish GED Social Studies. It's really memorable to me that there I was teaching and working, representing Columbia and contributing valuable community service in the area.
