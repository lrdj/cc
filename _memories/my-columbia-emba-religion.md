# EMBA Religion

Religion, spirituality and the Columbia EMBA program are words few string together.  Ironically, a humbling realization of the dedication and unimaginable sacrifices made by program participants and educators alike, in retrospect, has brought me profound clarity.  The Columbia experience was far more than just surviving an unthinkable workload; it was about inspiring growth--personal and community. Not only has the Columbia experience helped us to prosper as individuals, it has encouraged and enabled us to do the same for our communities.  And that is what this world needs more of.
