## Overheard: St Augustine builds on Claire Shipman's new term welcome message

Re this [announcement from Claire Shipman](https://president.columbia.edu/news/getting-ready-start-new-academic-year)

> ...as Dean Carlos Alonso noted, being at Columbia

# A Sermon for the Beginning of Term

My brothers and sisters, we stand at the dawn of a new academic year. The air is full of promise — fresh books opened, friendships renewed, strangers soon to be companions in study. Renewal is the gift of each September, as life begins again.

Yet behold these gates, shut fast behind us. What is their message? That knowledge is to be hoarded? That the city, whose very life makes this university flourish, must be kept at bay? If the term begins with renewal, then let it not begin with fear.

The City of God is not walled against the world, but shines forth to it. 

Truth is not fragile; it is strengthened by encounter. To close the gates is to confess weakness, to admit that our community is not sure of itself. But to open them — ah, that is to declare confidence, to show that learning welcomes the stranger, and that Columbia belongs not to itself alone, but to the world it serves.

Therefore I say: let the new year begin not only with convocation, but with courage. Let the gates be opened, and let knowledge walk freely once more between campus and city.

Amen.

_My personal take is that "being part of the fabric of something bigger" with a security checkpoint at 116th street is more like being in West Berlin was like being in West Germany. Come on Claire, do better..._
