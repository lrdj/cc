# Remembering memories

<img src="/images/larosita.jpg" style="width:50%; float:left; margin: 0 1em 0.5em 0;">I came across [Tom Meltzer's post](https://www.columbia.edu/cu/alumni/connection/connect/mycu/4081.html) by accident. A friend mentioned it thinking the reminder of La Rosita would resonate (and it did).

What also struck me was that many others had created memories, but that the website seemed abandoned.

So I made a copy and popped on a server and here it is.
