_Anouncement from Claire Shipman, acting president, Columbia University [May 7, 2025](https://president.columbia.edu/news/wednesdays-disruption-butler-library)_


# Columbia's president teaches by example how important are the teachings of the Core Curriculam

_St. Augustine and John Locke consider and interpret Claire Shipmant's statement on the Butler Library disruption, especially its emphasis on disruption, safety, and order._


## St. Augustine: On Order, Justice, and the Misplaced Peace

Augustine, in The City of God, famously distinguishes the City of Man —- governed by earthly peace and law —- from the City of God, rooted in higher justice. In his worldview:

* Order imposed by force, without moral legitimacy, is not true peace. It is a fragile substitute.
* Peace is only righteous when ordered toward the good, not merely compliance or calm.

How he might respond:

Augustine would likely see Columbia’s declaration of disruption and enforcement--not through counsel, but through police-—as an echo of the City of Man. Yes, the reading room was seized, chaos ensued, safety jeopardised. But by framing _obedience to university rules_ as the sole yardstick of justice, the statement sacrifices moral ambiguity for institutional tranquility.

* Requesting NYPD to eject students is treated as civic hygiene rather than a moral choice—and thus eerily reminiscent of Augustine’s warnings about institutions substituting order for justice ([president.columbia.edu][1], [Jewish Telegraphic Agency][2]).
* The letter’s definition of protest as a violation, rather than political speech, denies dissent its place as an act of conscience.

Augustine would remind us: <q>True order serves the soul’s orientation to divine justice—even when it disrupts peace.</q>

## John Locke: On Liberty, Consent, and the Limits of Authority

John Locke, whose political philosophy underpins much of modern liberal thought, holds:

* Authority is legitimate only when framed through consent and the common good.
* Punishments must be proportionate and focused on harm—not mere disruption.
* Penal responses should be civil and rehabilitative, not assumptive or coercive.

How he might assess Claire Shipman’s language:

Locke would likely applaud the university’s intention to maintain study space and safety—but he’d critique the infraction-based logic and mass sanctions:

* The phrase _“violation of University policies”_ is repeatedly used as if the rules themselves were beyond contest, rather than subject to communal political judgment ([president.columbia.edu][1], [communications.news.columbia.edu][3]).
* Sanctions spanning suspensions, expulsions, and degree revocations raise Locke’s concern: _Does disruption equate moral culpability or harm?_ The risk is imbalanced punitive measures without nuanced deliberation — not a system built on proportional justice. Reuters, JTA, Al Jazeera report how sanctions were broad and mass-applied ([reuters.com][4]).
* Locke would question the legitimacy of collective punishment when individual motives vary—some participants may have engaged peacefully, others out of conscience.
* The absence of an accountability structure beyond administrative decision-making (no mention of democratic faculty-student consultation or appeal processes beyond internal board) would disturb him. Process must always remain open to challenge, especially when rights are curtailed.

## Finally

Both thinkers would share unease: that in the name of preserving order, Columbia’s leadership has constructed a narrative where _policy violation_ replaces _ethical reflection_— and _punishment_ replaces _dialogue and consent_. Whether divine order (Augustine) or social contract (Locke), each would demand that authority be exercised not merely to suppress, but to reflect and rehabilitate the moral life of the community.
