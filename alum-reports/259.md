# my favorite text book

While at Columbia we used Richard Courant's "Differential and Integral Calculus."

It's been my constant companion for forty years.

I taught mathematics for twenty years and never found a textbook comparable.

Unfortunately it went out of print around 1950.

It now costs $300 at Amazon.
