# Best Teacher

It's not too easy to know what best means.  Trilling was overwhelming; we all wanted to be him.  Casey was mesmerizing; we emerged from his classroom as from a seance.  Perhaps the "lowly" Kent Hieatt was actually the best classroom teacher.  I used to show him my writings.  I wanted to be a novelist; he encouraged me to become a professor.
