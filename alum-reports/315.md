# Wild Turkeys on Campus

I have fond memories of morning coffee on the back porch of the Monell Building for international climate research at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO).  On one occasion, I spent a few moments with two charismatic wild turkeys. Where else on Columbia's campus can that happen?   Lamont is a peaceful respite from university's urban setting and, for me, the most beautiful part of campus.
