# New Religion

I was at Columbia at a special time - the late 60's.  I was a good Jewish boy from Brooklyn.  Due to certain life style influences, my pre-existing religious beliefs were totally fragmented.  I became newly spiritual based on the experiences, mostly extra-curricular, prevalent at that time.  It was the time of the hippies.  Peace, love, rock and roll.  This probably sounds stupid, but I suppose you had to be there.
