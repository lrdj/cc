# Keeping Warm in NYC

Winters can get pretty cold in New York, with the wind whistling down the canyons of the streets and avenues. With Columbia's proximity to the Hudson River, an added chill off the water adds to the overall frigid effect.  As a native New Yorker, I learned a neat trick early on to keep the warmth in and the cold out.  By planning my walking route to include major subway lines, the Broadway line being one of these, I could walk over the subway grates and feel the warmth of the subway tunnels rising up to keep me warm and toasty. So on my way to or from home to class, the walk could be made a little less icy by following the trains.
