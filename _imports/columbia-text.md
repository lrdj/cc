More than two decades after his death in 1972, Mark Van Doren remains a 
cherished figure at Columbia College. On the occasion of the great teacher's 
centennial, we asked a distinguished group of former students and 
colleagues to reflect on his continuing presence.

Letters to the Editor 


Not always the same deity 

The article by Professor John D. 
Rosenberg '50 in Columbia College 
Today ["The Imperiled Heart of the 
Core," Winter/Spring 1994] is as clear 
a statement as any I've seen of what 
the College's core curriculum is all 
about. I often have occasion to hear 
alumni talk about their devotion to the 
Sacred Core, but I'm not sure they 
understand that they don't all worship 
exactly the same deity; the Core has 
been and should be in a constant 
process of reexamination and change. 

The difficulty of preserving the Core 
parallels the difficulty of preserving 
need-blind admissions: The gradual 
increase in the size of the College, and 
the gradual decrease in the size of the 
Arts and Sciences faculty, are produc¬ 
ing a squeeze that will be very hard to 
cope with, absent a shift of some sort in 
fiscal priorities at the University level.

Visitors of Columbia College. 

The impact of Humanities 

Professor Rosenberg's article in CCT is 
the best summary Thave ever seen of 
the reason why the Humanities course 
had such an impact on generations of 
College students. For me the books and 
instructors have faded (although not 
Mark Van Doren), but the influence of 
Humanities on the way I think remains. 

I hope that the financial pressures that 
have led to the ever-increasing size of 
the College and the reduction of student 
access to the seniors of the faculty— 
under pressure to produce research, 
research, research—will not quietly bury 
the core curriculum piece by piece as 
fewer and fewer faculty want to teach it 
(or are capable of teaching it), or destroy 
it through such quick-fix solutions as 
the 60-student Music Humanities sec¬ 
tion, which was happily abandoned 
after a one-semester experiment.

High hopes, high standards 

As a former Lit Hum student of 
Professor Rosenberg, I was moved by, 
and in complete accord with, his mas¬ 
terfully presented article in CCT. The 
Core was for me one of the main 
attractions of Columbia over peer 
institutions, and his early-morning 
seminar during my first semester did 
a great deal to confirm my high hopes. 
It is not too much to say that the stan¬ 
dard of expectations set by his effec¬ 
tiveness as a teacher were met again 
only a few times over the course of my 
four years.

Attracting the right people 

Professor Rosenberg's CCT article is 
nothing short of brilliant. I've never 
seen a better case made for continuing 
the core courses unblemished, and I 
hope his views carry the day. It took 
courage to advance his ideas so force¬ 
fully, but he did so respectfully, and 
with tact. 

The core courses are expensive 
because of the limits on class size; 
teaching them has. to be very hard 
work, and the experience may not be 
as rewarding as other assignments 
might be in terms of career advance¬ 
ment. So attracting the right people to 
teach core subjects must be difficult to 
do. But that's so important!

Our ungainly notions 

It goes on, in the pages of Columbia 
College Today, the face-off over Vietnam, 
enacted in almost ritual fashion: my 
generation says why the war was 
wrong, previous generations conspire 
not to hear. In the case of both Diana 
Trilling and David M. Blank '41, the 
elders perform their part to perfection 
[Letters, Fall '94]. 

Yes, 60's college students were full 
of adolescent arrogance and naivete 
and yes, our view of the world was 
ridiculously simplistic, just as Mr. 
Blank charges. I said as much in my 
previous letter. Mr. Blank, attend 
closely and maybe you'll hear it this 
time: I've questioned more than once 
and much more than "slightly" my 
faith in "earlier views." And yet, a 
quarter of a century later, after all the 
baby fat of my politics has melted 
away, when I look back on Vietnam, I 
still think the war was wrong, and that 
our elders, locked in every sort of 
Cold War posture, were rarely of any 
use in helping us understand it. 

What was the war in Vietnam? I 
don't expect to wrap this question up 
in the next few sentences but one 
thing's for sure: it was not just a 
response to Stalinism. It drew too 
clearly on the cruelest and most racist 
aspects of the American past, and 
brought them into relief. Vietnam was 
modeled on policies that include the 
near extermination of Native Ameri¬ 
cans and the war in the Philippines, 
during which strategic hamlets were 
developed and massacres much like 
My Lai were all too common— 
prompting Mark Twain to denounce 
American generals as "Christian 
butchers." 

Now that it's over it should be pos¬ 
sible to acknowledge that the Cold 
War was marked not just by the Gulag 
but by American-backed dictators and 
American-implemented or supported 
atrocities around the world. (We're 
still cleaning up that mess, in Haiti 
and elsewhere.) We, the students of 
my generation, were caught in the 
middle of it all, and if we developed 
some ungainly notions of the truth it 
was partly because our country's lead¬ 
ers were so obviously and shamelessly 
telling lies. 

Mr. Blank points out evils brought 


The Core strikes a chord. 












LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 


about by Ho Chi Minh & Co. in 
Southeast Asia. True, and also true 
that in 1968 I wouldn't have thought 
them possible. My world view began 
breaking apart in the mid-70's, when 
China invaded Vietnam. Time seems 
to have done nothing to correct Mr. 
Blank's tunnel vision, though. He can't 
acknowledge that some of the more 
hideous events in Southeast Asia were 
tied to American involvement. It took 
Nixon's illegal incursions into 
Cambodia, for example, to turn the 
previously marginal Khmer Rouge 
into the moral monster it became. 

Mr. Blank writes that the uprising 
in Czechoslovakia in 1968 was more 
important than the war in Vietnam. 
Maybe, maybe not. So what? The 
truck skidding out of control in your 
direction on the highway may be less 
important than global warming but 
not at the moment and not to you. Mr. 
Blank adds, quoting Yale graduates 
Michael Mandelbaum and Strobe 
Talbott, that it took more courage to 
support Lyndon Johnson's policies in 
Vietnam than to oppose them. Again, 
even if he's weighed the cojone factor 
correctly, which I doubt, so what? It 
takes more courage to wear white 
robes and a pointed hood north of 
125th Street than not to, proving 
absolutely nothing. All I can say is that 
even back then and despite all our 
illusions, for many in my generation 
the prospect of the fall of Soviet com¬ 
munism was every bit as delicious to 
contemplate as a swift end to the war 
in Vietnam. 

But you really don't have to strain 
too hard to detect the limitations of Mr. 
Blank's position. After all, he takes the 
word of Yale graduates over that of 
Columbia alumni. I bet he prefers 
Elliott Abrams (blame him on Harvard) 
to Mark Rudd. I'm sorry, but I must 
dare call it treason.

Acknowledging a tragic disease 

I want to applaud Robert Pollack's 
kind and sensitive eulogy of Professor 
Eric Holtzman '59 [Eall 1994]. He truly 
was an outstanding individual. I am 
one of those physicians who got his 
first exposure to serious biology in 
Professor Holtzman's 3041 class. I nei¬ 
ther worked harder nor learned more 
in any class I took at Columbia. 
Professor Holtzman stands out as one 
of the two or three greatest professors 


I have ever had, in college, medical 
school or graduate school. 

I only wish Professor Pollack had 
gone one step further in his final 
remarks. Depression can be a doubly 
tragic disease, destroying its victims' 
lives twice; once in the living hell it 
produces in its sufferers, and a second 
time in the suicide which often seems 
to be the only escape from this hell. 
Often, the pain of its living victims is 
compounded by the shame they feel in 
a society which has highly stigmatized 
mental disease. One step in ending 
this stigma is acknowledging publicly 
the existence and cost of mental dis¬ 
ease, especially depression, the most 
widespread of the serious mental ill¬ 
nesses. But it must not, like cancer in a 
previous generation, be acknowledged 
only through implication, as if there 
were still something to hide. We must 
call it by its name and give it a proper 
identity. Professor Pollack should have 
said outright that Professor Holtzman 
suffered from depression (from which, 
indeed, I can only assume he suf¬ 
fered), rather than calling his malady 
"a disease our neurons are prone to," 
poetic as that phrase may be. Only 
when we can fully confront these terri¬ 
ble diseases and acknowledge them by 
name, will we be able to treat them as 
the shameless physiological problems 
they are.

Editor's note: Professor Pollack's remarks 
were originally delivered to a gathering of 
Eric Holtzman's immediate family, col¬ 
leagues and students. 



The show that went on...and on. 


Forever young 

Your photo spread on this year's 
reunion [Fall 1994] certainly brought 
back memories of a great summer 
weekend. I was particularly pleased to 
see a picture of (from left to right) 
Allison Castillo, Harris Dew, myself 
and my husband, James Graham, fea¬ 
tured on the same page as Andrew 
Delbanco, one of my favorite profes¬ 
sors at Columbia. 

Youthful as we may appear dancing 
at the barbecue, however, we're not 
students any more! A1 and I are Class 
of '89, Harris graduated in '92, and 
my husband graduated (from UMass 
Amherst) in 1985. It's probably our 
continuing to live in New York City 
that has kept us all looking so young.

Compelling fare 

Congratulations on the Varsity Show 
issue of Columbia College Today [Fall 
1994]. I have legitimate claim on Dart¬ 
mouth and Harvard as an alumnus, 
and Penn and Columbia as a fund rais¬ 
er—magazines from each are familiar 
fare. But your latest issue compelled 
reading from cover to cover. The arti¬ 
cles by Professor Edward Said, Roald 
Hoffman '58 and Jason Epstein '49, and 
Professor Casey's letter, all made for 
fascinating reading, whether or not one 
agrees with all the premises. Very 
meaty stuff compared with some of 
your fellow editors.

Sing a song of Morningside 

Thanks ever so much for the Varsity 
Show issue of CCT. You certainly did a 
thorough job of research and produced 
a delightful report (really, a disserta¬ 
tion) on the subject. 

The portions dealing with my own 
period of the mid-20's brought back a 
lot of good memories, and the names 
of the men I worked with: Corey Ford, 
Paul Winkopp, Morrie Watkins, Roy 
Webb, Jack Barzun, Lionel Trilling, 

Ben Hubbard, Perry Ivins. 

Unmentioned was Leo Henning— 
though he only coached the dance 
numbers for two years, he was respon¬ 
sible for a professional attitude which 
set a standard for several succeeding 
years in the period which (in my preju¬ 
diced opinion) is the high point of Var¬ 
sity Show history. Leo was as demand¬ 
ing about practice and perfection as any

athletic coach. Also we especially 
appreciated his introduction of the 
Charleston at the very beginning of the 
craze, so the pony ballet was most pop¬ 
ular with our social friends, especially 
the girls, because we could teach them 
"the hottest new dance." 

The performances in the rococo 
grand ballroom of the old (34th Street 
& Fifth) Waldorf were the most glam¬ 
orous of events—both backstage and 
out front. The cast dressed in the crys- 
tal-chandeliered anterooms and many 
an ornament ended as an earring on 
our "female" characters. 

At that more innocent time, it was 
considered not only acceptable but pro¬ 
fessionally correct for the "women" of 
the cast to attempt to appear as femi¬ 
nine as possible. It was about then that 
a "beefcake" ballet of heavy-footed 
jocks was introduced, but only as a one- 
shot number. Over the years, as cus¬ 
toms and tastes changed, they replaced 
the legitimate ballet altogether. 

Again in my prejudiced opinion. 

Old Kings and Half Moon Inn were the 
best efforts at a seriously presented 
musical comedy—and in vigorous 


competition with Harvard's Hasty 
Pudding, Princeton's Triangle Club 
and other Ivy League shows; and we 
even toured! (Of course, it goes with¬ 
out saying that as times changed. 
Varsity Shows had to, and doubtless 
today's productions are as representa¬ 
tive of student talents and attitudes.) 

By junior year I had become so 
deeply involved in serious dramatic 
theater (Philo, the Lab Players, six 
extra hours a term of no-credit theater 
courses) that I had given up the fun- 
filled Varsity Shows. However, three 
days before the opening of "His 
Majesty the Queen" one of our great¬ 
est "leading ladies," Henry Grant, 
injured his ankle. I find it hard to 
believe, but in 72 hours I learned his 
dialogue, songs and dances. And since 
there was no Actors Equity union for 
college actors, I didn't even get a slip- 
sheet insert in the program booklet! 

Enough ramblings from this ancient 
greybeard. It was a time when "Old 
New York" indeed had a concern for 
the "College on Broadway"—even its 
teams. I have always thought of 
Varsity Shows as one of the several 


influences that led me into theater for 
a richly satisfying professional life— 
though it early turned from acting to 
administration.

Footlit exhilaration 

I enjoyed Tom Vinciguerra's excellent 
article on the Varsity Show. Working on 
these shows for four years bonded me 
to Columbia more than any other activi¬ 
ty, academic or otherwise. We worked 
amidst constant explosions of creativity, 
and if we were blown off the track occa¬ 
sionally the trip was always exhilarat- 
ing. 

I've been a regular reader of CCT, 
and I'll be keeping the Fall 1994 issue.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 


How to hurt a guy 

What a magnificent job you did in 
researching and in writing the Varsity 
Show story. By placing it in its proper 
historical perspective, you floodlight 
an unbelievable pageant of what it has 
meant to Columbia, to its participants, 
to its audiences, and to New York the¬ 
ater. Varsity Show is an amazing cata¬ 
lyst of creativity. 

Someone came down a little hard on 
Ben Hubbard. For the years that 1 
knew him, his hawk nose, ever-present 
pipe and tweed jacket were just the 
right symbol of solidity we all needed. 

I would agree with Mr. Hubbard—to 
open a Varsity Show with the pony 
ballet would be a lot like the fat lady 
opening with her high note. 

1 love the contrast between the 
dancers in the 1940 show on page 35, 
and the dancers in the '94 show on the 
back cover. You really know how to 
hurt a guy. 

Let's hope the article will encourage 
support of Varsity Show (not too much 
support)—just enough to provide fer¬ 
tile soil for all those campus talents. 

Long Live Varsity Show.

Dead to rights 

Thanks very much for highlighting me 
in the recent issue of CCT [Headliners, 
Fall '94]. One minor correction, how¬ 
ever; Last June I didn't perform a 50th 
anniversary concert for the JVC 
Festival. It was titled "The Musical 
World of Dick Hyman." I think that 
there may have been some confusion 
with another concert presented by my 
colleague Billy Taylor a few days 
before, which did celebrate his 50th 
anniversary in the music business. 

Fifty years ago I was a freshman and 
hadn't even written the Varsity Show 
Dead to Rights which, as your fine fea¬ 
ture documented, took place in 1947.1 
like to think that my career began 
when I graduated in the following 
year. When you get to be my age, four 
years makes a big difference! 

At any rate, keep up the good work. 
The magazine is in terrific shape, and I 
look forward to each issue.

Off-Broadway style 
Thank you for a wonderfully informa¬ 
tive and interesting history of the Varsity 
Show. As an "old Player" and veteran of 


"Professor William Casey's 
wartime letter was an 
intriguing reminder of the 
extraordinary effort needed 
for the free world to defeat 
the Axis challenge...How 
many of my generation — 
the youth of World War II — 
are adequately responding 
to the current global crisis 
of biological extinctions, 
resource depletion, and 
environmental degradation 
that is as great a threat 
as that once posed by 
Germany, Italy, and Japan?"

the shows of the mid-50's, I was gratified 
to see so many fondly remembered 
names and titles included in the article. 
However, I feel compelled to point out 
an omission that I consider significant. 
You credited Streets of New York as the 
record-holder for campus revivals, but 
you failed to say that a completely 
revised version of Streets opened Off- 
Broad way in October 1963 and ran for 
nearly a year at the Maidman Playhouse 
on West 42nd Street. The new score was 
composed by Richard Chodosh '49 and 
the revised book and new lyrics were 
written by the late Barry Alan Grael '52, 
who also played one of the leads, as he 
had in the '52 campus edition. This edi¬ 
tion of Streets won not only a set of rave 
reviews, but also the Vernon Rice Drama 
Desk Award as best Off-Broadway 
Musical of the Season. 

As evidence of the quality of this 
new Streets, consider what Alan Rich 
had to say several years later in New 
York magazine: "My own favorite New 
York musical... (was) a small but imagi¬ 
native entertainment called Streets of 
New York. .. .The show had style, wit, 
bustle, and a marvelous, edgy ingenuity 
in both music and words.... I can think 
of nothing worthier of revival than this 
show." 

Neither can I.

The threat we all face 

Professor Casey's wartime letter ["The 
Professor and the Soldier," Fall '94] 
was an intriguing reminder of the 
extraordinary effort needed—in finan¬ 
cial and organizational terms, as well 
as military ones—for the free world to 
defeat the Axis challenge. 

The youth he praised in the 1940's 
are the elderly of today, but our society 
faces a challenge of equal magnitude: 
environmental problems and their 
associated social ills. Robert Kaplan, 
writing in The Atlantic Monthly, assert¬ 
ed that "the 'environment' is the 
national security issue of the 21st cen¬ 
tury." The litany of global issues is well 
known to nearly everyone—acknowl¬ 
edged by those who recognize the 
finiteness of the earth and of its life 
support capacity, denied by those who 
believe that human intelligence guided 
by a free-market economy is infallible. 

In my estimation, the threat posed 
by biological extinctions, resource 
depletion, and environmental degrada¬ 
tion is as great as that posed during 
the 1930's by Germany, Italy, and 
Japan. That threat was accompanied by 
attention-getting cannon fire, explod¬ 
ing aerial bombs, and later by the 
arresting voice of Edward R. Murrow. 
The approaching environmental disas¬ 
ter is accompanied primarily by devas¬ 
tating silence—the silence of starved 
children and old men and women, the 
silence of slaughtered and starved ele¬ 
phants, rhinos, tigers, porpoises, and 
whales, the silence of once-(over)- 
active fishing fleets. Only the stuttering 
cough of semi-automatic weapons in 
the hands of inner-city children pre¬ 
sages the growing breakdown of our 
own social order. 

How many professors of my gener¬ 
ation—the youth of World War II—are 
adequately responding to this global 
crisis and preparing their students for 
it? What will today's professors say 
when their ex-students eventually ask, 
"Why wasn't I told?"

Gold Baton: ABC News president Roone Arledge '52 accepted the highest honor of the Alfred 1. duPont- 
Columbia University Awards on behalf of his organization at a nationally televised ceremony on January 
26. Joining him on the Low Rotunda dais were (from left): Judy Woodruff of CNN, Peter Jennings of ABC 
News, Tom Brokaw of NBC News, and University President George Rupp. 

In a recently published history of ABC Neivs, The House That Roone Built, author Marc Gunther 
tells of the deep impression made on the young Mr. Arledge by his professors in the College, especially 
Lionel Trilling '25 and Mark Van Doren: "Reading the classics with Van Doren made such an imprint that 
years later Arledge could recall class discussions and quote Shakespeare from memory." Mr. Arledge has 
been president of the news division since 1977. In 1979, the College presented him the John Jay Award for 
distinguished professional achievement, in the first year the honor was accorded. photo: joe pineiro

• SERVICE CULTURE: 
Changing the University's "ser¬ 
vice culture" has become a top 
priority for Executive Vice Presi¬ 
dent for Administration Emily 
Lloyd, in the wake of a Decem¬ 
ber report from the Task Force 
on Student Services, chaired by 
Professor George W. Flynn. 

Better employee orientation 
and training in customer ser¬ 
vice; improved student access 
to critical information through 
the ethernet and other sources; 
and restructuring of the Career 
Services office under direct 
College management—all are 
well under way, reports Ms. 
Lloyd, who will be relying on 
student surveys and her own 
jam-packed e-mailbox for direct 
student reaction to changes 
under way. 

"Students today have grown 
up in a world where they are 
treated to a higher level of ser¬ 
vice than people were 20 years 
ago," she commented. "Whether 
it's the phone company or a trip 


to Disney World, or how they're 
treated when they call up to 
order something from the J. 
Crew catalogue, they're served 
in a very courteous, solicitous 
way—'Call us 24-hours-a-day, 
no problem. We can Fedex it.' 
And that's what they expect on 
this campus. That what a well- 
run organization does to indi¬ 
cate that they value you. When 
they get here and find a differ¬ 
ent attitude, they perceive it as 
abrasive and hostile. We really 
have to change that, because it 
does not reflect how the Univer¬ 
sity feels about its students." 

• IN SEARCH OF: Two search 
committees are at work seeking 
successors for Steven Marcus '48, 
who now serves as both Dean of 
the College and Vice President 
for Arts and Sciences and who 
has announced that he is resign¬ 
ing for health reasons. Provost

the committee assigned the task 
of finding the new vice president, 
said in mid-February that he 
expected the position to be filled 
within weeks. Dr. Cole also said 


that the search was down to a 
handful of candidates, all of 
whom were from outside the 
University. 

The dean's search committee, 
chaired by Professor of Art History 
and Archaeology David Rosand 
'59, has begun its deliberations; the 
new vice president is expected to 
play a role in the selection process. 
Other College alumni on the com¬ 
mittee are Alumni Association 
President Martin S. Kaplan '61 
and Board of Visitors Chairman 
George Ames '37. 

• CONSERVATION: A $6 mil¬ 
lion gift from the V. Kann Ras¬ 
mussen Foundation, which will 
establish the Center for Environ¬ 
mental Research and Conserva¬ 
tion (CERC) on campus, is 
expected to make Columbia the 
most comprehensive academic 
center devoted to species con¬ 
servation. Joining the project are 
four other institutions, including 
the New York Botanical Garden 
and the American Museum of 
Natural History. 

"This consortium is a res¬ 
ponse to one of the great envi¬ 


ronmental crises of our time, 
the disappearance of a large 
and increasing number of 
species of plants and animals 
from the wild," said the cen¬ 
ter's new director. Professor of 
Anthropology and Biological 
Sciences Don Melnick. "We 
envisage the center as a place 
where researchers will work on 
issues of very immediate, prac¬ 
tical importance." 

• OVERHAUL: A year-long, 
$12.25 million renovation will 
begin on Fumald, the 80-year-old 
residence hall, immediately after 
Commencement. Among the 
major features of the project are 
enlarged floor lounges/kitchens; 
separate bathrooms for the sexes; 
air conditioning; state-of-the- 
art telephone, cable television, 
and Internet systems; and a 
redesigned first-floor lounge to 
provide adequate egress for 
such large-scale gatherings as 
Folkfest. A dean's office or 
graduate school information 
center is also possible. During 
construction, residents will be 
housed in the graduate dorms 
Watt and Woodbridge; it is 
expected that Woodbridge will 
remain an undergraduate site. 

Long the most coveted resi¬ 
dence on campus, Furnald will 
be even harder to get into once 
the work is done: the expanded 
facilities will yield a dorm with 
233 beds, down from 263. 

• TRUSTED EMISSARY: Low 
Library veteran Paul D. Carter 
stepped down as a senior presi¬ 
dential adviser this past fall 
after 30 years service to Colum¬ 
bia. As Executive Vice Presi¬ 
dent for Administration from 
1971 to 1985, he oversaw Uni¬ 
versity personnel, facilities, 
security, budget and planning, 
student services, and publica¬ 
tions, and helped guide the 
campus's extensive building 
and restoration program. 

At a farewell reception in 
October, former President 
Michael 1. Sovem '53 called 
Mr. Carter "a trusted emissary, 
astute adviser, and good friend," 
and thanked him for having 
"made it possible to avoid a sue- 











AROUND THE QUADS 


cession of disasters and catastro¬ 
phes large and small." Alluding 
to the former Rhodes Scholar's 
striking looks, Mr. Sovern 
quipped, "In other words, he's 
not just another pretty face— 
although [my wife] Joan used to 
call him James Bond." 

• commemoration: The 

AIDS Memorial Quilt will come 
to campus on April 22, in the 
largest showing of the quilt in 
New York since 1987, according 
to Rozz Nash '95, one of the 
event's organizers. Some 300 of 
the 12-foot-square commemora¬ 
tive panels, handmade by 
friends and relatives of AIDS 
victims, including a number of 
Columbia alumni, will be dis¬ 
played on South Lawn and 
elsewhere on campus. For more 
information, contact Ruby 
Chin '95 at (212) 853-1096; to 
volunteer, contact Michael Susi 
at (212) 854-6108. 

New student 
activities center to 
replace FBH 

The proposed renovation of 
Ferris Booth Hall has been 
scrapped in favor of a much 
bolder plan to raze the obsolete, 
overcrowded student activities 
center and to construct a new 
complex with twice the capacity. 
The project, approved by the 
Trustees last fall at the recom¬ 
mendation of University Presi¬ 
dent George Rupp, could begin 
as early as the summer of 1996 
if funds are secured. Dean of 
Students Roger Lehecka '67 gave 
a tentative price tag of $40-50 
million; the work would take up 
to three years to complete. 

The plans are being drawn 
up by the architecture firm of 
Gruzen Samton Steinglass and 
Architecture School Dean 
Bernard Tschumi. Design fea¬ 
tures include enhanced dining 
services, modern studios for 
WKCR, music practice rooms, 
central mailboxes (so students 
may have one address for all 
four years), and an expanded 
'Plex. 

A new, larger auditorium has 
been outlined, one that could 
be partitioned, or used fully to 
accommodate up to 1500 peo¬ 
ple, thus permitting an entire 


class to assemble in one place. 
"That by itself is a significant 
problem," noted Dean Lehecka. 

Plans call for "dramatic pub¬ 
lic space that would face the 
campus," said Mr. Lehecka. An 
atrium with a series of ramps is 
envisioned; Director of Design 
and Construction Irwin Lefko- 
witz described a split-level 
design that would take advan¬ 
tage of Broadway's lower ele¬ 
vation than the campus but 
would still be "respectful" of 
the original McKim, Mead & 
White campus architecture.

Picturing the 
right chemistry 

Columbia chemistry professors 
are looking forward to the day 
when their students rarely 
crack a book. 

That doesn't mean studying 
will be a thing of the past. 
Rather, the students will be able 
to trade printed pages for com¬ 
puter screens. And to a group of 
Columbia scientists and under¬ 
graduates goes the credit of tak¬ 
ing the first steps toward creat¬ 
ing a library of computerized 
chemistry—as well as develop¬ 
ing a new classroom technology. 

The original idea was to 
apply the remarkable graphic 
powers of computers to the dif¬ 
ficult task of visualizing chemi¬ 
cal concepts and processes. 
Chemistry involves kinetic 
processes, changes from one 
state of matter to another, and 
dynamic rearrangements of 
molecules and atoms—all of 
which are best understood 
when graphically depicted. 

"When you're dealing with 
complex molecules, it's hard to 
imagine them," said Professor of 
Chemistry Bruce Berne. "Unless 
you're a genius." 

Professor Berne and col¬ 
leagues Leonard Fine and 
Nicholas Turro had been think¬ 
ing of introducing a course that 
would address this challenge. 
At around the same time, the 
National Science Foundation 
announced it would invite grant 
proposals on how to revolution¬ 
ize college chemistry curricula. 
Columbia put together a pro¬ 
posal that eventually became 
the EDISON Project (no relation to

for Communicating Chemistry, 
with a $250,000 budget drawn 
from the University, the N.S.F., 
and the Dreyfus Foundation. 

With the help of post-doctoral 
student Peter McGarry, a pilot 
program was designed whereby 
students would learn to visual¬ 
ize chemical phenomena by cre¬ 
ating them themselves. Eighteen 
undergraduates were selected, 
mainly first-years, and two- 
thirds of them from other uni¬ 
versities. Throughout the sum¬ 
mer of 1994, using commercially 
available software and depart¬ 
mental computers, they met 
daily with each other and week¬ 
ly with Mr. McGarry to compare 
notes, brainstorm, and hash out 
how to devise the models. 

By the end of July, the stu¬ 
dents had created a dozen dif¬ 
ferent entries. Zita Peterlin '98 
came up with a tf\ree-dimen- 
sional program of amino acids; 
Dan Lin '96 opted for a module 
dealing with carbon dioxide. 

The results were unveiled at an 
impressive show in Havemeyer: 
atoms twisted about each other, 
pendulums swung, and charts 
practically vibrated with chang¬ 
ing values. 

The students had mastered 
new computer skills and Pro¬ 
fessor Fine reports that their 
modules are being used in class¬ 
es ranging from the high school 
to the graduate level. "If we 
build enough modules," he 
adds, "we can cover the first two 
years of chemistry." (Admittedly, 
"many dozen" additional mod¬ 
ules would be needed, he says.) 

The EDISON project begins a 


process that administrators 
expect will spread across the 
University. "In terms of teaching 
and learning, it's a paradigm 
shift—a new form of literacy," 
said vice provost Michael Crow, 
who with University Librarian 
Elaine Sloan has been a strong 
proponent. "Research shows 
that people learn in a visual 
mode, and the new media tech¬ 
nology allows us to do that." 

"It has great potential," said 
Kapil Kumar '97, whose module 
dealt with controlled reactions 
inside the restricted spaces of 
zeolites. "When people first start 
getting into chemistry, they think 
it's overwhelming, a 'hard' sci¬ 
ence. This helps break it down." 

The chemistry department 
now offers the course envi¬ 
sioned by its designers—W4300, 
Computational Chemistry: Vis¬ 
ualization and Modeling—and 
plans to repeat the summer pro¬ 
ject, this time hoping to bring 
faculty members and their stu¬ 
dents from other schools to 
Morningside Heights. To accom¬ 
modate the expanding program, 
the N.S.E. has approved funding 
for a $1 million multimedia 
classroom on the second floor of 
Havemeyer. Most of the money 
is in hand; the room is expected 
to be ready this fall.

Human rights 
soldiers 

Despite all appearances in the 
tiny, cramped office on the 11th 
floor of the International Affairs 
Building, Columbia's Center for 


the Study of Human Rights is 
the nerve center of an impres¬ 
sive international network. 

Since 1984, when the center 
began sending law students 
abroad to help complement 
course work with practical 
experience, the human rights 
internship program has circled 
the globe. Each summer, about 
10 College students are engaged 
by such organizations as Africa 
Watch, UNICEE, and the Ameri¬ 
can Civil Liberties Union, fight¬ 
ing a battle without borders 
across four continents. The pro¬ 
gram's goal is to provide ser¬ 
vices to developing countries 
while encouraging undergradu¬ 
ates to pursue a career in 
human rights, says the center's 
director, J. Paul Martin. 

"Some years ago, there was 
a hesitancy to send undergrad¬ 
uates overseas," he says. "But 
through the years we have 
been very impressed by their 
real contributions to human 
rights groups, by the value of 
the insights they gain and by 
the knowledge they bring to 
both the classroom debate and 
extracurricular activities." 

According to Dr. Martin, 
more and more young Ameri¬ 
cans are working for nascent 
human rights groups around 
the world. What the Columbia 
interns bring to the program, 
he says, is a certain expertise— 
computer and administrative 
skills and knowledge of mod¬ 
ern systems like banking and 
communications. "But more 
importantly," he adds, "they 
are not experts." Unlike senior 
consultants, most interns live 
and work in the heart of the 


communities their host organi¬ 
zations serve. 

"We bring an ear to listen to 
the stories that the rest of the 
world doesn't hear," says Alycia 
Clawson '95, who interned last 
summer in El Salvador, a nation 
struggling to find civil peace 
after its bitter 12-year civil war. 
"People in the war suffered for 
so long as refugees, displaced 
people, or combatants," says Ms. 
Clawson, "that there is a fierce 
distrust in the peace accords." 
Interviewing mayors, communi¬ 
ty leaders and ordinary citizens, 
Ms. Clawson helped analyze the 
progress of the government's 
reconstruction program. Among 
the communities she toured was 
the town of El Mozote, which 
had suffered an immense mas¬ 
sacre during the war. "It was a 
ghost town," she recalls. "No 
schools, no water, no electricity, 
no roads. The level of destruc¬ 
tion is incredible." 

Megan Hester '96 arrived 
last summer in the central 
African nation of Malawi short¬ 
ly after its first multiparty elec¬ 
tions were held and a new con¬ 
stitution was drafted after 30 
years of one-party rule. Ms. 
Hester described her experi¬ 
ence in the former British pro¬ 
tectorate as "reliving 1776." 

"Malawi is a country where 
there is no word for 'democracy' 
in Chichewa, the language 
of most people," she says. 
"Freedom of expression and 
freedom of association, things 
that we in the United States take 
for granted, are ideas that are 
just taking shape in Malawi." 

Using a smattering of 
'Swahili, buttressed by such 
























AROUND THE QUADS 


techniques as sketching and 
role playing, Ms. Hester docu¬ 
mented hundreds of incidents 
of beatings, harassment, and 
torture under the regime of Dr. 
Hastings Kamuzu Banda. 

Katie Fleet '95, a third-year 
alumna of the program, worked 
with the Nicaraguan Center for 
Human Rights as a legal aide. 
She accompanied investigators 
into neighborhoods that had 
been terrorized by displaced 
military troops to record injuries 
and deaths. She recalls driving 
into one village as a skirmish 
broke out between group of mil¬ 
itants and the police; "There 
were horrifying sights of 
wounded bystanders, including 
children. To know that the inter¬ 
view I could do with the victims 
of such attacks and that writing 
their names down would have 
important implications put 
much into perspective for me." 

It was College Dean Jack 
Greenberg '45, himself a noted 
human rights activist, who 
originally estabished the Law 
School internship program and 
then extended it to the College 
in 1991 with the help of an 
anonymous grant. 

Today, such internships are 
increasingly viewed as not only 
worthy in their own terms, but 
also useful in preparing for 
careers in both private-sector 
and government organizations, 
says Arthur Helton '71, who 
heads the Soros Foundation's 
migration program. Formerly 
the director of a refugee project 
at the New York-based Lawyers 
Committee for Human Rights, 
Mr. Helton supervised intern 
Linda Kirschke '94, who trav¬ 
eled to West Africa two years 
ago. At 23, Ms. Kirschke is now 
the Africa researcher for the 
London-based organization 
known as Article 19, which 
monitors free speech issues 
internationally. 

A recent surge in human 
rights education has placed 
Columbia's center at the heart of 
the fastest growing area of 
human rights. In one week last 
summer. Dr. Martin received 
calls seeking assistance for 
human rights education pro¬ 
grams in Haiti, Namibia, Taji¬ 
kistan, Romania and Tanzania. 
And the interest has not waned.

Requests in 1995 have come from 
as far as Uganda, Zimbabwe, 
Israel, Nepal, Peru and Romania. 
Still, despite the great need and 
continuous demand for interns 
around the world, the necessary 
financial resources have not been 
easy to secure. Dr. Martin hopes 
to link students and College 
alumni with similar interests to 
help allay the travel and housing 
expenses, which range from 
$2,000 to $3,000 per intern. 

"With all that is happening 
around the world, we cannot 
afford to be as ignorant as we 
have been," he says. "This pro¬

Alumni who lived in Furnald 
Hall at any time between 1945 
and 1981 remember the genial 
Ben Jerman, who ran the dorm's 
mail room and gladdened thou¬ 
sands of students by greeting 
them personally, remembering 
their names and home towns, 
and handling discreetly the 
many ticklish and unbelievable 
situations college students have 
a knack for creating. 

Ben keeps up with his 
Furnald friends. Now retired and 
living in Brooklyn, he called CCT 
recently and mentioned that he 
celebrated his 52nd anniversary 
with Jane last July, followed by 
his 80th birthday in August; they 
enjoy regular family reunions in 
Weatherford, Okla., with their 
daughter, grandchildren and 
great-grandchildren. After 
attending a Welsh gathering in 
Bellevue, Wash., Ben started 
planning a return journey to his 
own home town of Aberfan, in 
South Wales. 

"I love receiving CCT. I read 
it cover to cover—there are so 
many names I recognize," Ben 
said. He also likes reading arti¬ 
cles in the local papers written 
by Furnald alumnae such as 
Jami Bernard B'78 of the Daily 
News and Anna Quindlen B'74, 
until recently of the Times. 

"I'm shocked and amazed 
that he would remember me," 
said Ms. Quindlen, when told of 
Ben's remark. She and her hus¬ 


band, Gerry Crovatin '74, dated 
in college under Ben's benevo¬ 
lent gaze, and certainly remem¬ 
ber him. They recently donated 
$1000 in Ben's honor to the 
Furnald renovation campaign, in 
response to a private appeal let¬ 
ter from James Minter '73, anoth¬ 
er loyal Jerman-ophile. 

"He was the closest we came 
to civility," Ms. Quindlen said 
of Ben. "He was in loco grand¬ 
parentis. I think they ought to 
name the lobby for Ben."

Arthur B. Krim '30 
(1910-1994): 

He quietly lent 
his succor and 
strength 

"I was Arthur Krim's lawyer!" 
exclaimed his former colleague, 
Seymour Peyser. "It was like 
being Albert Einstein's science 
teacher or Joe DiMaggio's bat¬ 
ting coach." 

The occasion was a memori¬ 
al service at Lincoln Center's 
Alice Tully Hall on December 6 
for Arthur B. Krim '30, the 
noted lawyer, motion picture 
executive, adviser to three U.S. 
Presidents, and Chairman 
Emeritus of the University's 
Board of Trustees, who died 
last September 22. 

Mr. Peyser's respect and 
affection were seconded by an 
extraordinary group of friends 
and admirers who gathered to 
celebrate Mr. Krim's lifetime of 
service and accomplishment. 
Nearly always out of the spot¬ 
light—except for rare moments 
such as his acceptance of the 


Jean Hersholt Humanitarian 
Award at the Academy Award 
ceremonies in 1975, and Colum¬ 
bia's Alexander Hamilton 
Medal in Low Rotunda a year 
later—Mr. Krim was an angel 
to dozens of leading film direc¬ 
tors, to the Democratic Party 
and the civil rights movement, 
to Israel and the anti-apartheid 
movement in South Africa, and 
not least, to his alma mater. 

"What Arthur Krim did 
spelled the difference between 
success and failure for us when 
everything else was going 
wrong," said William J. McGill, 
who was Columbia's President 
in 1977, when Mr. Krim began 
his five-year term as trustee 
chairman. Dr. McGill credited 
Mr. Krim for leading the Univer¬ 
sity to adopt a policy of ethical 
investment in South Africa. It 
was then an unusual step for 
American universities, and. Dr. 
McGill noted, Mr. Krim raised 
the ante by insisting that the 
new policy, and the ensuing 
divestment of securities, would 
be meaningless unless conduct¬ 
ed publicly. 

After one major New York 
bank chairman summoned Dr. 
McGill to denounce the policy 
and threaten withdrawal of 
financial support, Mr. Krim was 
reassuring. "Forget it," he said. 
"That guy has a cash register 
where his heart should be." 

Reminding his audience of 
the years of campus protest then 
fresh in mind. Dr. McGill shared 
another reason he felt gratitude 
for Mr. Krim's moral leadership: 
"It enabled me to run rings 
around student radicals for the 
remainder of my term." 

Mr. Krim was a reassuring 
presence as well for Presidents 
John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. 
Johnson and Jimmy Carter. Mr. 
Carter joined in the service 
with a videotaped message (as 
did Jodie Foster, Sidney Poitier, 
Bishop Desmond Tutu and sev¬ 
eral other luminaries). Lynda 
Johnson Robb offered particu¬ 
larly warm memories of Mr. 
Krim's relaxed sessions of 
dominoes and conversation 
with her father at the LBJ 
Ranch. "Daddy and Arthur 
were great friends. There was 
none whose company he val¬ 
ued more and whose advice he 


cherished more," she said. 

Born in New York City, Mr. 
Krim was a brilliant student in 
the College and at Columbia 
Law, where he edited the Law 
Review and graduated in 1932, 
the same year he began his life¬ 
long association with the firm 
of Phillips, Nizer, Benjamin, 
Krim & Ballon. In World War II, 
Mr. Krim served as an Army 
lieutenant colonel on the staff 
of the future Supreme Court 
Justice William Brennan. For 
four decades Mr. Krim was a 
leading figure in the film indus¬ 
try, as head of United Artists 
and then Orion Pictures, two 
film companies distinguished 
by their support of creative 
freedom for directors. Their col¬ 
laborations resulted in 14 
Oscars for Best Picture, for such 
films as Marty, West Side Story, 
Tom Jones, Midnight Cowboy, One 
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, 
Annie Hall, Amadeus and The 
Silence of the Lambs. The direc¬ 
tors he worked with—among 
them Truffaut, Fellini, De 
Palma, Lumet, Altman, Forman 
and Woody Allen—repaid his 
confidence by creating great 
movies. But Mr. Krim himself 
never sought to emulate the 
legendary moguls of the indus¬ 
try. "He was not interested in 
the glitter," said John W. Kluge 
'37, chairman of Metromedia. 
"He dominated Hollywood but 
did not allow it to change him." 

Moments later, Mr. Kluge 
earned heartfelt applause when 
he announced that his company 
would donate $500,000 to the 
American Foundation for AIDS 
Research, which is chaired by 
Mr. Krim's wife of 35 years. Dr. 
Mathilde Krim. Other large 
contributions were announced 
by Michael Fuchs of HBO and 
the producer Norman Lear. 

"Arthur Krim was engaged in 
some of the master passions of 
our time," said the actor and 
director Ossie Davis, who 
remembered that Martin Luther 
King Jr. and other civil rights 
leaders "depended on him for 
advice and succor and strength." 
In a taped message, former 
Prime Minister Abba Eban 
praised Mr. Krim's devotion to 
Israel, "which is the cause of the 
survival and redemption of the 
Jewish people," he said. And for-

In Memoriam 

The College recently mourned 
the loss of two distinguished 
members of its faculty: 

Robert Austerlitz, Professor of 
Linguistics and Uralic Studies 
Emeritus, died in the Bronx on 
September 9 at the age of 70. 

Chairman of the linguistics 
department from 1965 to 1968, 

Mr. Austerlitz was a renowned 
and popular authority on pho¬ 
netics who specialized in the lan¬ 
guages and cultures of Northern 
Eurasia. His wide-ranging 
research came to include descrip¬ 
tive grammar, the historical 
reconstruction of grammar and 
vocabulary, and the formal struc¬ 
ture of poetry and music. A for¬ 
mer president of the Linguistic 
Society of America, he received 
many honors, among them the 
order of Kiiight Eirst Class, 

Order of the Lion of Finland. 

Howard McP. Davis, the Moore 
Collegiate Professor Emeritus of 
Art History, died on September 
9 at the age of 79. 

Forty years on the faculty, 
departmental chairman from 
1969 to 1972, Mr. Davis was one 
of Columbia's legendary teach¬ 
ers; his classes on Italian Renais¬ 
sance and Northern European 
painting were among the most 
popular in the College. He was 
one of the early shapers of Art 
Humanities, and he was com¬ 
mitted to making visual literacy 
a serious goal of general educa¬ 
tion. Mr. Davis received both 
the Great Teacher Award and 
the Mark Van Doren Award; he 
was also honored with the The 
Howard McP. Davis Human¬ 
ities Study Gallery in 
Schermerhorn Hall. 

A memorial fund in Professor 
Davis's name has been estab¬ 
lished for the enhancement of 
Art Humanities. A memorial 
service will be held on April 28 
at St. Paul's Chapel.

The core texts: 
classic and ever-changing 


Are the texts of Columbia's 
core curriculum an exclusive, 
fixed canon, or are these liter¬ 
ary masterpieces alive and 
decidedly unfixed to the many 
generations that have encoun¬ 
tered them? A new exhibition 
in Butler Library suggests 
strongly that each wave of 
readers has been engaged in 
its own searches for the mean¬ 
ings of these books. 

hi Pursuit of Meaning: 
Classic Texts from Columbia's 
Core Curriculum, an extraor¬ 
dinary collection of nearly 
100 items from the Rare Book 
and Manuscript Library, 
examines the actual physical 
embodiment of core texts 
going back more than 2000 
years. "Format, textual edit¬ 


ing, translation, illustration, 
commentary, and imagina¬ 
tive adaptation have all 
played a part in each genera¬ 
tion's recreation of these clas¬ 
sic works," notes Jean 
Ashton, Director of the Rare 
Book and Manucript Library. 

The texts represented 
include such familiar required 
reading as the Bible, King Lear, 
and the Communist Manifesto. 
Historical milestones abound: 
The first numbered, limited 
edition of the Aeneid, printed 
at the Louvre in 1798, is on 
display; Galileo's Sidereus 
Nuncius appears in its first 
printed edition. Many works 
are represented by more than 
one format—both the Iliad 
and Odyssey, for example, are 


displayed in papyrus frag¬ 
ments dated from the third 
century B.C. to the first cen¬ 
tury A.D., in their first print¬ 
ed appearance of 1488, and 
as a portable 16th-century 
Aldine edition presented to 
Martin Luther by Philip 
Melanchthon. The Odyssey 
is also represented in its 
inspired 20th-century trans¬ 
formation, Ulysses, shown in 
the copy seized by U.S. 
Customs and marked by the 
district attorney. 

The exhibit runs from 
March 2 through June 5 in the 
Kempner Exhibition Room of 
the Rare Book and Manuscript 
Library on the sixth floor of 
Butler, Monday to Friday 
from 9 a.m. to 4:4^ p.rr

Roar Lion Roar 

The winning formula 


"We're euphoric. We're in seventh heaven/' 
exulted Connie Maniatty '43 after the 
Lions nailed down their first winning 
season since 1971 with a raucous 38-33 
victory over Cornell on national televi¬ 
sion last November 12. 

Mr. Maniatty was speaking as chair¬ 
man of the Football Advisory Committee, 
but his rapture was shared by legions of 
Columbia fans, for whom 1994 was truly 
a season to 
savor. 

It had been 
six tough years 
since the pro¬ 
gram pulled out 
of the horrific 
44-game nose 
dive known as 
The Streak, a 
sojourn in 
sports hell "that 
lasted longer 
than the Civil 
War," as a sym¬ 
pathetic Wall 
Street Journal 
piece noted that week. (No one at 
Columbia gloated—though some admit¬ 
ted their relief—when the Prairie View 
A&M Panthers of Texas eclipsed the 
Lions' NCAA record the same week by 
losing their 45th in a row.) 

For the students who now suit up for 
the Light Blue, anything that happened 
before '89 is part of the ancien regime. The 
monkey is off their backs. 

"We had the best leadership we've 
had in a long time, especially from our 
seniors," said Head Coach Ray Tellier, 
when asked to state the number-one rea¬ 
son for the turnaround. On board since 
1989, he also points to some long-term 
factors: greater success in recruiting tal¬ 
ented athletes with strong academic cre¬ 
dentials; the increasing popularity of 
Columbia and New York in college 
admissions; the recent Ivy League rule 
limiting football recruits to an average of 
35 players a year, which benefits a small¬ 
er school like Columbia; and better train¬ 
ing facilities and support systems. 

Many feel the list should be headed by 
Coach Tellier himself, who has brought 
stability and quality to the once-troubled 
program. "He's what we've always been 
looking for," said Mr. Maniatty. "He's 
knowledgeable, he's principled, he's 
done a terrific job." 


For his part, Mr. Tellier prefers to talk 
about the accomplishments of his staff 
and his players. 

Co-captain tight end Brian Bassett 
became Columbia's most decorated 
football veteran since John Witkowski 
'84, gathering third-team All-America 
laurels, as well as first-team All-East 
and All-Ivy honors. Ten Lions earned 
All-Ivy honors, with a seven on the first 
team: co-captain quarterback Jamie 
Schwalbe; linemen Tony Petras, Craig 
Valentine, Marcellus Wiley and Eric 
Keck; and linebacker Rory Wilfork, as 
well as Bassett. On the second team 
were kicker Joe Aldrich and free safety 
Jim Hudnall; cornerback Ralph Hudson 
was honorably mentioned. In addition, 
seniors Bassett, Schwalbe and Hudnall 
were each named Academic All-Ivy. 

Although Columbia got off to a 
shaky start in '94—with a harrowing 
last-minute loss to Harvard, followed 
by a tie at Lehigh on a missed extra¬ 
point kick—the team soon found its 
groove. 

The QB tandem of Schwalbe and 
Mike Cavanaugh sparked the most 
productive Lion offense since 1961, 
while defenders held opponents to 13 
points or less for six consecutive 
games. A week after their 30-9 thrash¬ 
ing of Yale in New Haven, the Lions 
wowed a record Wien Stadium crowd 
with a 17-10 Homecoming victory over 
Princeton. For Columbia partisans (if 
not grieving Yankee fans), it was a glo¬ 
rious October in New York. 

The era of good feelings continued 
until the third quarter of the season 
finale. Then, leading by 24 points, the 
Lions allowed Brown to rally for eight 
unanswered touchdowns in 22 min¬ 
utes—an extraordinary collapse, bad 
enough to conjure evil spirits of yore. 

For Tellier, it was an alarm bell, a 
motivator, a lesson about lack of back¬ 
bone. "You just can't let someone come 
back from 27-3 in your own house;" he 
said. "In games like that, where momen¬ 
tum shifts, we have to have a response. 
We have to learn how to come back and 
win that game 40-39." 

Only when that happens, he said, will 
the team reach its next goal—"not a win¬ 
ning season, but a winning tradition."

Columbia College Today 


P erhaps no teacher in the history of the 
University has acquired a more devot¬ 
ed following than Mark Van Doren 
(1894-1972), whose recent centennial 
furnished an occasion for alumni to 
remember the 40 years of service that 
made his name synonymous with great teaching at 
Columbia College. 

The son of a country doctor, Mark Van Doren was born 
in 1894 in Hope, Illinois, and became one of the most 
accomplished American literary figures of the 20th cen¬ 
tury. In addition to his teaching career at Columbia, he 
produced a large and varied body of 
scholarly and critical works, as well as 
short fiction and reviews, and, of course, 
poetry, for which he. was awarded the 
Pulitzer Prize in 1940. He was one of the 
founders of the College's famed Litera¬ 
ture Humanities course and is' closely 
associated with the movement for general 
education in America. He retired in 1959. 

We permit ourselves the hope that 
Professor Van Doren might have been 
pleased by the tributes included here— 
among them recollections offered by 
some of his closest friends, colleagues 
and former students. By all accounts he was a deeply 
modest man, but when he was rightly praised—praised 
sincerely and for his accomplishments—he enjoyed it; 
he tells us so in the charming account in his Auto¬ 
biography of a surprise party held for him in 1945 at the 
Algonquin Hotel in honor of his 25th anniversary of 
teaching at Columbia. Clifton (Kip) Fadiman '25, 
"famous for his felicity in the role," acted as master of 
ceremonies, introducing one after another of a glittering 


assembly that included Mark's brother Carl, the 
philosopher Scott Buchanan, Joseph Wood Krutch, John 
Berryman '36, James Thurber, Jacques Barzun '27, 
Lionel Trilling '25, and the mystery writer Rex Stout. 
Fadiman varied the routine by reading aloud from let¬ 
ters sent by those unable to attend in person—Mortimer 
Adler '23 from Chicago, Robert Lax '38 writing from 
"heaven knows where," Thomas Merton '38 from his 
retreat at Gethsemani. 

"When it was all over," Van Doren wrote, "naturally I 
had to speak. I decided only at the last moment what to 
say. It was that I accepted their praise. I threw none of it 
back at them as exaggerated or unde¬ 
served. If they loved me I loved them 
too, and I was not ashamed to admit it. 
The acceptance of gifts and praise exact¬ 
ly in the spirit in which they are offered 
has always seemed to me one of the chief 
duties of man." 

In a letter that was read at the Algonquin 
that evening in 1945, Thomas Merton 
made an observation that will surely res¬ 
onate for many of Van Doren's former stu¬ 
dents. "With you it was never a matter of 
trying to use poetry and all that is called 
English literature as a means to make peo¬ 
ple admire your gifts," Merton said. "On the contrary you 
always used your gifts to make people admire and under¬ 
stand poetry and good writing and truth."

VAN DOREN AT 100 


Columbia College Today 


Three former students 
of Mark Van Doren — 
who all followed his 
example to become 
distinguished-poets, 
teachers, and critics 
in their own right — 
weigh their teacher's 
continuing presence in 
their lives and work. 



A conversation with Louis Simpson '48, 

John Hollander '50 and Richard Howard '51 

Van Doren's mark 


Interviewed for Columbia College Today 

CCT: Can you each in turn tell us how you first 
came to meet Mark Van Doren, and describe him for 
those of us who know him only as a legendary name, 
a revered figure of the past? 

Louis Simpson: My first contact with Mark was 
in my sophomore year, when he took three of 
my poems for a little book he put out every 
year, Columbia Poetry. And then I had a seminar 
with him in Hardy and Yeats. After that I took a 
course with him in Shakespeare. We became 
friends. I didn't push it—he never liked that. 

My sense was that he never sought intimacy 
with his students. 

John Hollander: That's interesting. I think we 
all had the same feeling. And yet he must have 
been doing some kind of seeking. 

Richard Howard: There must have been an 
invitation, but it was not in any sense a conven¬ 
tional one. He didn't like certain kinds of atten¬ 
tion or intimacy and he didn't suffer fools gladly. 

Simpson: He could be very tough on a student 
who was being foolish. I knew one very bright 
young man who worried terribly about his 
grades and so on. And Mark just told him one 
day to get out and take a long time coming back. 

Hollander: When I finally met Mark Van 
Doren, I had, in a sense, been over-prepared for 
the encounter because I had heard his name 
spoken of with a certain kind of awe by my 
mother, who had taught Mark's children John 
and Charles when they were at the High School 
of Music and Art. 

Mark had seen some of my poems and said a 
kind word about them, which meant a tremen¬ 
dous amount. In those days there were people 
one really looked up to. If there was the slight¬ 
est hint of encouragement—if somebody said of 
your writing, well, it's not terrible, it's not all 
bad—that was marvelous. It meant you could 
go on and try to get better. 

He was very generous, very pointed. He 
would look at something I'd done and point to 
something that I considered trivial, irrelevant, a 
passing move—something I hadn't thought 
about. And he'd say that's where it's working 
best, and then leave me to puzzle out the 
important lesson: that there were certain things 
you could do, and certain things you had to 
learn to do—and that you didn't even notice 


BY Oliver Con ant and James C. Katz '72 

when you were doing what you could do, but 
there was a lot of fuss and bother when you 
were trying to do what you couldn't. 

The first class I took with him was called 
Verse. He would hand out a mimeographed, 
unidentified poem and talk about it—and he 
insisted that we talk about it. There was a cer¬ 
tain amount of digression, which, I think, 
infected me, because my faults as a teacher 
tend to be digressive ones. I loved those digres¬ 
sions: He would stop and pause in the middle 
of something, and take off on it. I remember 
some electrifying moments. 

Mark gave us a two-hour final exam for that 
class: For the first hour you were to write a 
poem, right there in the exam room. And then 
for the second you were to talk about it. Which 
was quite audacious—remember, this was not a 
class for creative writing students. This was for 
people going to law school and medical school, 
who nevertheless delighted in that assignment 
and everything else. 

Another marvelous course I took was called 
The Narrative Art—Homer, Dante, Cervantes 
and Kafka. We read the Iliad and the Odyssey, 
all of the Divine Comedy, both parts of Don 
Quixote —he was intent on getting across the 
importance of understanding the second part in 
relation to the first—and then The Trial and The 
Castle. That too was audacious in the late 40's— 
to see those as sublimely great works. 

Howard: Unlike Louis and John, I came to 
Columbia from out of town. I was from Ohio, 
and I had heard of a number of people at 
Columbia whom in some sense I wanted to be 
near because they were in the New York liter¬ 
ary world—among them Joseph Wood Krutch 
and Mark Van Doren and Lionel Trilling. Mark 
was often on the radio and in magazines, his 
poetry was published everywhere, and he 
spoke as a cultural figure in all kinds of forums. 
I was eager to brush up against that figure, or 
to be in its presence. 

For me he was a representative man, as a lit¬ 
erary person and as a poet. I was very eager to 
observe any possible clues he might supply as to 
how one went about being a writer. Specifically, 
being a poet. 

Like John, I took Mark's course on Verse, and 
I remember taking poems to his office. I also 
remember talking to him when his brother Carl

died. I had never had a brother and was inter¬ 
ested in how he felt. He was quite forthcoming 
up to a point. And then came a moment when 
he said: "Really, this is none of your affair." 1 
remember that very, very vividly. 

CCT: You have all followed Mark Van Doren's 
example in becoming poets, critics, and teachers. Is 
there anything in that lineage that troubles you 
now, or that you reject? 

Simpson: For me it was a troubled lineage, 
very troubled. Years ago John asked me to do a 
book on Van Doren for some series he was 
doing, and 1 had to say no. At that time I was 
very turned off by certain aspects of Mark's 
teaching and writing. My feelings about it are 
still greatly mixed. 

I love him, as we all did, obviously. But I felt 
that the kind of life he had as a professor just 
drained him of the kind of energy that, from 
my point of view, should go into one's writing. 

Now, that may be unfair and it may be a ter¬ 
rible thing to say, and 1 may be wrong. Maybe 
Mark was always going to be the kind of 
teacher/writer he was. But that tremendous cre¬ 
ativity in the classroom, where he's 
actually writing aloud, what does 
that leave you for your writing? My 
problem with Mark, in a nutshell, has 
always been this: How could some¬ 
one who knew so much about litera¬ 
ture—contemporary literature, I don't 
mean just Homer and Shakespeare 
and Chaucer—how could someone 
like that not apply any of it, as far as 1 
can see now, in his own poetry? 


Hollander: His teaching was far more auda¬ 
cious than most of his writing was. 

Simpson: That's sort of what I'm trying to say. 

Hollander: 1 think having to brood about this 
problem is part of Mark's heritage. 

I remember that when I was quite young I 
tried to keep my academic work as separate 
from my poetry as possible. Eventually 1 
reached a time in my life—I was about 40— 
when I realized that wasn't going to work. 1 
wanted both parts to be more like each other. 
With Mark there was something seamless. 

Howard: Louis, do you think he would have 
been a modernist poet? 

Simpson: Well that's a question 1 can't answer, 
of course. But on the train this morning, 1 
reread the poems and 1 realized how, to put it 
brutally, old-fashioned they are. 

Howard: 1 wrote an essay about Good Morning, 
his last book, which was used as its preface. I 
concern myself there with precisely this subject, 
with his being an "old-fashioned poet." But 
you know, I really think that's the poet he 
wanted to be. Although he was 
extremely various and ambitious and 
tried all kinds of things—long 
poems, novels in verse, plays—there 
was a great range to his notion of 
possibilities; his manner of approach¬ 
ing these possibilities was usually a 
conservative or a conventional one. 

Hollander: Rather like Robert 
Graves in that regard, whose most 



















18 


VAN DOREN AT 100 


Columbia College Today 


remarkable poetry, I've always felt, occurs in 
certain prose works. 

Simpson: You know, I always assumed that 
Mark was very affected by Robert Frost. And 
people used to say that. But rereading his auto¬ 
biography, he's very cool about Frost. Not at all 
warm. And the poet Mark says that he learned 
to write from is Dryden. He says so explicitly. 


It's hard to estimate a poet's reputation. He 
can have one reputation with his peers, another 
reputation with the public, and then a reputa¬ 
tion with the eminent critics of the time. And I 
think Mark was pretty much neglected by the 
New Critics. 

Hollander: Although there was very consider¬ 
able praise for the Shakespeare. 


"There was a certain 
kind of veneration that 
polished his counte¬ 
nance. I resented that. 
I was always glad to see 
him lose his temper." 
—Richard Howard 



Howard: It's a poetry of statement. 

Simpson: Statement: Now, that's not very big 
these days. 

Hollander: That's not modernist poetry? Oh, 
these days there's almost nothing but poetry of 
statement! 

Howard: When we began, you spoke of Mark 
Van Doren as being legendary and revered. 
Well, not any more. He's an obscure figure. Not 
even the prose books are in print. And I have 
no student who knows there is a large body of 
poetry of great interest. I like it still. I think he's 
a genuine American poet, a significant figure. 

Simpson: But the lack of reverence for him among 
literary critics, and so on—all that started way 
back. In his own time, remember, Mark made a 
public statement that he had turned away com¬ 
pletely from contemporary criticism, had nothing 
to do with it. 


John Hollander '50, the distinguished poet 
and critic, is A. Bartlett Giamatti Professor of 
English at Yale University. Among many hon¬ 
ors he has received are the Bollingen Prize in 
1983 and a five-year MacArthur Fellowship. 

His most recent works, both published by Knopf 
in 1993, are Selected Poetry and Tesserae. 

Richard Howard '51, who won the Pulitzer 
Prize in poetry in 1970, is also renowned for 
his criticism and his English translations of 
Baudelaire, Gide, Camus, De Gaulle, Barthes 
and other French authors. He is University 
Professor of English at the University of 
Houston and Poet Laureate of New York State. 
Mr. Howard's latest collection of poems is Like 
Most Revelations (Pantheon, 1994). 

Louis Simpson '48, one of America's most 
respected poets and critics, has taught at 
Columbia, Berkeley, N.Y.U. and the State 
University of New York at Stony Brook, where 
he is Distinguished Professor Emeritus of 
English and Comparative Literature. The win¬ 
ner of the 1964 Pulitzer Prize in poetry, Mr. 
Simpson has recently produced a memoir. The 
King My Father's Wreck (Story Line Press, 
1995), and a book of essays and notes on poet¬ 
ry, Ships Going into the Blue (University of 
Michigan Press, 1994). 


Howard: And for The Noble Voice and for the 
Dryden. That book was much admired, as we 
discovered, by T.S. Eliot—which, of course, 
meant a great deal in 1948. 

Hollander: More than it should have. It's 
interesting to specify what Eliot's approval 
meant. It meant that there was something acad¬ 
emically hard-edged and tough about what he 
could do—so it was all right that he then did 
whatever he wanted in the classroom. 

Howard: And then there were all those little 
books analyzing Twelve Lyric Poems. 

Simpson: His method of writing criticism, as he 
described it, is rather fascinating. He would 
read everything and then just write straight 
through. The Shakespeare reads like that. 

Hollander: That book just defies critical genre, 
because he'll move from giving a close reading 
of a speech to summing up whole vast realms. 
Or he'll launch into some of that marvelously 
weird stuff he could sometimes do in class. I'll 
never forget his saying to me—he said it in class 
and then I bugged him about it afterwards— 
that the reason Hamlet can't kill the king is that 
it will put an end to the play and it’s all so inter¬ 
esting. It's too interesting to put an end to! 

Now what kind of remark is that? That's like 
Hazlitt. We could imagine Hazlitt, who was a 
brilliant critic, saying something like that. Not 
too many since. Maybe Swinburne. 

Simpson: That's the thing about Mark's talks, 
that you could see him making it up as he went 
along. It was an absolutely astonishing perfor¬ 
mance. 

Van Doren also made a big point about what 
he learned from students. He says that several 
times—that he learned from them how to teach. 
As a matter of fact, he says that the Shakespeare 
book resulted from his interaction with students. 

Hollander: This is important. In the humani¬ 
ties—language and literature, certainly philoso¬ 
phy—a lot of what universities call your 
research, your academic work, as opposed to 
your teaching, is actually done in teaching fresh¬ 
men a book you've taught fifty times before. 

That is, you learn and discover things, not just 
about how to teach, but about your subject. 

Simpson: Yes, and you can also lose what you've 
learned when you go back to a book. Because, 
you know, three years ago, you thought you

understood Camus' The Stranger; now you can't 
make sense of it. 

Hollander: That's right. 

Howard: Mark really delighted in saying such 
things. You could watch him when he was 
making those great embroideries; suddenly he 
would discover his subject or his theme, and 
his face would light up with the realization that 
he was now going to say something that he had 
never thought of before. 


Simpson: I think of Mark's life and his teaching 
as based on a concept that is very much under 
attack now. Mark simply thought that writers 
were holy people. He thought poetry was just 
the ultimate truth. And his whole object was to 
get that feeling across to you. The kind of thing 
that's come in with post-structuralism, which is 
that it is language that writes, there are no such 
things as authors—he must be whirling in his 
grave! He had this tremendous feeling for the 
individual he was teaching. I think he loved lit¬ 
erature in a way that very few people do.

Van Doren thanked

"7 love him, as we all 
did, obviously. But I 
felt that the kind of life 
he had as a professor 
just drained him of 
the kind of energy 
that should go into 
one's writing." 

—Louis Simpson 



CCT: Do you think he himself aspired to 
be one of the elect? 

Simpson: I think so. I think that a 
man or a woman who puts that 
much energy and time into writing 
hopes—all of us hope—that weTl 
leave something that will put us in 
that company. I think Mark certainly 
took himself terribly seriously as a 
writer. And that is why I can't under¬ 
stand why he didn't get at his own 
writing more seriously. 

Hollander: I think that the historical moment 
supported his identity as poet/man of 
letters/teacher, all at once, in a way that it does 
not today. People read, not just in universities. 

Simpson: And when Mark gave talks on radio 
and television, he was reaching out from the 
university in a way that has largely disap¬ 
peared. 

As poets, the three of us here have always 
operated to some extent outside the universi¬ 
ties—more so than the average professor. But 
criticism now has practically become an 
enclave within the university, in which people 
only talk to each other. This is a cliche, but it's 
true. I'm very irate about this. Because once 
that kind of hermeticism is ensconced it repeats 
itself. You hire people like yourself. It's pretty 
appalling. 

CCT: Van Doren is spoken of as an ideal kind of 
teacher, a person who could teach teachers. Has the 
chain from Van Doren's example to today's academy 
been irreparably broken? 

Hollander: I don't know. It's interesting. 
Supposing we said yes, we'd like to return to 
this. I would say "lots of luck," because I don't 
know where you would find the teachers to do 
it. You would have to look at people and not at 
the unreadable trash they had published, how¬ 
ever "professionally" qualified. 

You know a mere ten years ago I would 
never have talked about responsible work in 
learned journals as trash. I might say something 
was uninspired or uninteresting, but I would 
talk about its reflecting a certain competence. 

No more. All most academics now know about 
is a constricted body of palaver in a particularly 
circumscribed discipline. Of course all of us 
have had students who could and would love 
to teach as Mark did and have simply been ter¬ 
rified, usually by their fellow students, out of 
exhibiting that care and concern. Students who 
still read under the covers with a flashlight, the 
way you did as a kid. 

Simpson: What about the great quiz show 
tragedy? Should we not discuss this? Or is it 
unimportant? 

Hollander: Well, since it's been brought up we 
can. 


I had, I think, like a lot of us, 
hoped that the way Charles might 
have behaved would be the only 
honorable way to behave, which is to 
say, "Of course it was all a fake, of 
course it's all a fix. This is a 
Congressional committee? You are 
investigating TV? TV is show biz. If 
you don't like show biz regulate it!" 

And instead Charles did a number 
which I did not like, which caused 
one of the members of the committee—a very 
conservative gentleman from Long Island, I 
believe—to say, after Charles made a clean 
breast of it, "I don't think a grown man ought 
to be applauded for telling the truth." 

Anyway, it was during this period I had a 
dream that I was walking down the street and I 
saw Mark. And he said, "But you don't under¬ 
stand, it's all so interesting." 

Howard: But he did say, "This is the happiest 
day of my life." 

Hollander: That's crazy. I prefer to rewrite 
him as saying, "It's all so interesting." 

Howard: But he did say that. It was one of his 
many remarkable utterances. 

CCT: Did the scandal create special problems for 
Van Doren in the intellectual community? Was 
there sympathy for him? 

Hollander: It wasn't that big a deal. The only 
thing that Charlie had done was to allow him¬ 
self to be used as a symbol of the intellectual, 
which he shouldn't have. 

Howard: I can still remember my mother, who 
had watched the whole episode with great 
interest on what was then a new medium, say¬ 
ing to me before it was exposed, "Dear, some 
people are able to make quite a nice thing out 
of their education." 

Simpson: When Charlie's meager teaching 
income at Columbia was revealed to the public, 
my family looked at me as though I was the 
idiot boy. I mean, when you work, that's all 
you get? 

CCT: One gets the impression that people thought 
of Mark Van Doren as a kind of saint. Is that close 
to what you think of him? 

Howard: No, that's certainly not how I thought 
of him. I knew some people thought he was 
venerable. I don't know about sanctity, but 
there was a certain kind of veneration that pol¬ 
ished his countenance. I resented that. I didn't 
like that. I was always glad to see him lose his 
temper. 

Hollander: Mark and sainthood just didn't go 
together. Not at all. I remember one winged 
word from him about sainthood, when he 
paused in the middle of something and said. 



















VAN DOREN AT 100 


21 


"Saints are so ruthless." One thing he was not 
was ruthless! 

Howard: That's right, not at all. 

Hollander: For me this was an important 
humanizing moment. I've never forgotten it. 

The remark attacks a smarmy, sentimentalized, 
pious notion of what sainthood is instead of 
what real sainthood is. 

CCT: Did Van Doren introduce you to 20th-centu¬ 
ry poets you hadn't read or otherwise act as a poetic 
guide? 

Simpson: Yeats, Hardy. He much preferred 
Hardy to Yeats. But I don't remember Mark 
offering much by way of guidance in contem¬ 
porary literature. 

Howard: He thought Hardy was the greatest 
poet of the 20th century—or in English. 

Simpson: He liked Hardy's humility. Hardy, he 
says, "reports on the world"—the chief busi¬ 
ness of a poet at any time. I think Mark saw 
himself as a sort of Hardy. 

Howard: Oh, yes, that's there. He saw himself 
as the lyric poet for whom there was always the 
next poem and the next and the next. As if to 
say, "This is the first poem, there was none 
before it. Do not misunderstand me. This is the 
first poem ever." And in a sense, if each poem 
is the first poem then there can be a thousand 
poems. Mark wrote much too much. I don't 
mind his not writing better or differently, but I 
do feel he would have been a much finer poet if 
he had edited down his oeuvre. 

Simpson: He told me something one time I 
must tell you. He said to me that if he didn't 
finish a poem that day —he wouldn't keep—he 
wouldn't do anything with it. 

Howard: Like Byron. 

Simpson: Mark told me once that Robert Frost 
showed him his poem, "Once by the Pacific," and 
said to him, "You know, there are lines that were 
written 40 years ago." And when I looked up the 
poem, I could see the sort of pre-Raphaelite quali¬ 
ty those lines had. Mark said Frost took another 
40 years to write that poem. But Mark would say 
if you don't finish a poem the same day it's no 
good. 

Hollander: But Hardy was like that too. 

Hardy finished poems started earlier and 
rewrote them long afterwards. 

Howard: Mark had a notion that there was 
always another poem to write—that he could 
write another and another. It's very unfashion¬ 
able, that notion, although it's a very useful one 
if you're learning how to be a poet. 

CCT: Are there any larger themes that we should be 
touching on that we've neglected? 


Howard: Sure there are. 

Hollander: I think we've been talking all the 
time about a number of large themes. One is 
the question of literature, its role in the univer¬ 
sity. Mark represented a time when it was not 
so totally professionalized that it professional¬ 
ized itself out of existence. 

Howard: It would have been interesting to 
have somebody younger here. I mean, we're all 
of an age. If you had maybe found somebody 
younger who by some accident still had some¬ 
thing to do with Mark... 

Hollander: We're all so sophisticated about 
people's stories about great teachers. But he 
really had a profound effect—certainly on 
young people who were interested in poetry. 

He made you feel that it was all right to care 
about this, it was not crazy. And that in itself 
was remarkable. 

I look back on myself now as an undergrad¬ 
uate with nothing but disapproval. As a 
teacher, I have for the last 30 years prayed for 
tolerance in dealing with the kind of under¬ 
graduate I was. But he was wonderful with me. 
He and Moses Hadas were the two people at 
Columbia who took me more seriously than I 
was able to take myself. 

Simpson: I just wanted to say one thing about 
Mark, that as I sit here, I think a lot of my feel¬ 
ings are mixed because I really felt about him 
like a father. I'm sorry to be so sentimental, but 
I felt that he was my father. He really was. 

My own father died when I was 15. And 
when I came to Columbia this man picked me 
out of the ruck and was my friend. And then 
when I went into the Army, in Texas, I got a 
postcard from him. My God, I wouldn't have 
been hired at Columbia but for Mark. And he 
never mentioned it. That's the fantastic thing. 
He got me a job here. He put me in the College, 
but he never said he did. Looking back, I got 
one of the big awards and I'm sure he was on 
the jury. And he never once mentioned any of 
this. And as you do with your father, I turned 
my back on him. 

You know, I had lunch with Mark one day up 
here, in the Faculty Club, and he said something 
which just finished me for a while—for years. 

He said, "You know, life is really a dream,"— 
he'd been teaching Cervantes—"life is a dream." 

I looked at him and I went away and said to 
myself, the hell it is! A dream? If life is a dream 
what are you going to call dreams? 

I was really mad at him for some years. But 
then I went to his funeral up in Cornwall. That 
was a very somber experience. Anyhow, he 
was a great man. He was a great man. The 
word great, what is it? That's what we're talk¬ 
ing about. It's very hard to explain, but he 
was a great man. 



"I'll never forget his 
saying in class that 
the reason Hamlet 
can't kill the king is 
that it will put an end 
to the play, and it's 
too interesting to put 
an end to !"

What he meant 
to us 

And how we remember him. 


Mortimer J. Adler '23 

In 1923,1 completed my undergraduate work at 
Columbia. I was then 21 years old, and I had 
not studied with Mark Van Doren in the 
College. 

It was my great good fortune to be asked to 
conduct with Mark one of the great books semi¬ 
nars that John Erskine had initiated at Colum¬ 
bia. Co-moderating one of these seminars with 
him from 1923 to 1929 enabled me to experi¬ 
ence the rich variety of Mark's methods as a 
teacher. 

He was an extraordinary questioner, persist¬ 
ing in question after question until he finally 
achieved the kind of understanding that he 
thought appropriate to the reading that had 
been designed for that session. 

Mark gave all of us who sat around the semi¬ 
nar table on Wednesday evenings insights into 
the pedagogical wonders of the Socratic 
method of teaching. The essence of that method 
is cooperating with the mind of the learner to 
be active, not passive. It is the very opposite of 
lecturing. My six years of teaching with Mark 
Van Doren was six years of learning I will 
never forget. 

Mark and I became close personal friends. 
When his sons Charles and John were born, I 
felt myself a member of the Van Doren family. 
Wednesday evenings after the seminar was 
over, I would join Mark and Dorothy at their 
house on Bleecker Street. These after-seminar 
evenings enriched me in a variety of ways. 

Our friendship continued after I joined 
Robert Hutchins at the University of Chicago. 
Along with Scott Buchanan and Stringfellow 
Barr, Mark joined Bob Hutchins and me in ses¬ 
sions at Chicago that led to the new program at 
St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland. 

Mortimer Adler '23, the author, editor, teacher and 
philosopher, directs the Institute for Philosophical 
Research in Chicago. 

Quentin Anderson '37 

from a eulogy for Mark Van Doren delivered on 

January 30,1973 at St. Paul's Chapel: 

The figures who move with authority through 
the passages of our youth have a kind of 
salience no later figure assumes... The presence 


of Mark Van Doren among us was—and 
remained—a kind of wonder to me—as if a 
species of spiritual levitation were being prac¬ 
ticed in the easiest and most unaffected and 
homely way. I had never seen anyone who 
seemed so complete in himself. It wasn't simply 
a matter of his finely molded and unremittingly 
expressive countenance; his sentences seemed 
wholly in accord with his whole being; he never 
seemed to speak in the service of an image of 
himself—no persona need be invoked for an 
occasion because the person was there all the 
time...The other strong impression that stayed 
with me was of the quality of the recognition he 
accorded others. Many of us can recall saying 
something we thought botched or imperfect to 
Mark, only to see his face light with a charmed 
attention, and to hear him turn what we had 
said about, give it shape and force, and offer it to 
our admiring view as the freshest of discoveries. 

Van Doren liked education when it was con¬ 
ceived as bare and athletic, when the art, so 
perishable in its exercise, the art of teaching, 
was summed as an encounter with a book. He 
had little patience with elaborate arrangements, 
which he suspected of standing in for the art 
itself, or as announcing an insufficient appre¬ 
hension of the challenge of the book. Some pro¬ 
fessors are themselves edited texts, prepared to 
sound one strand of themselves in search of a 
responsive twang from their students. The 
Mark Van Doren whose presence seemed to 
many students to pervade Hamilton Hall did 
not seem edited at all; in the poverty of our 
present imagination of human power we are 
led to compare the effect of his presence to the 
abundance and integrity of a work of art. But 
the proper way of putting it, one which speaks 
to the human courage he sought to cultivate in 
us, is to say that he lent dignity to art,, by con¬ 
ferring on it the dignity of its maker, man.

Professor of the Humanities Emeritus, taught 
English and American literature at Columbia from 
1939 to 1982.

lection One Hundred Poems —and the best part

qf his teaching came from the exercise of this 
gift. What he imparted about works of litera¬ 
ture was not their place or worth, but a series 
of perceptions peculiarly his own, distilled into 
clear language. He sat at a small table, motion¬ 
less and, speaking in an even tone, he seemed 
to review his past pleasure in the given author. 

This mode was not calculated to rouse the 
stolid, especially those in Mark's course in 
American Literature, which came in the slug¬ 
gish hour after lunch. As he himself remarked 
with characteristic humor, "I don't mind if the 
man in the back row begins to look at his watch 
half way through the hour, but when he takes it 
off his wrist, puts it to his ear, and shakes it, 
why... "At the same time he knew very well 
that others of us remained happily, gratefully, 
alert to his unique utterance. 

University Professor Emeritus Jacques Barzun '27 
and Mark Van Doren were among the founders of 
the College's Literature Humanities program, one of 
many adventures they shared as colleagues on the 
Columbia faculty for three decades. 

Clifton Fadiman '25 

from "What Makes A Teacher Great?" in Clifton 
Fadiman, Enter Conversing (Cleveland and New 
York: The World Publishing Company, 1962): 

"... Mr. Van Doren of course taught English in 
the sense that he did not teach mathematics; 
but his real subject was one on which no exami¬ 
nation could test you: human life. Mr. Van 
Doren...[was] a poet, that rare being in whom 
passion and repose carry on a peaceful co-exis¬ 
tence. In the classroom he never denied his 
vocation; he remained the poet, the poet as 
teacher. He taught us something simple, pro¬ 
found, sensible, and useful: that human life is 
enhanced if one can manage to see it with the 
imagination. There lay his subject, which the 
catalogue would label 'Shakespeare' or 'The 
Epic' or some other advertisable trade name. 

"... The great teacher does not bother to 'love' 
or 'understand' his students; he bothers to love 
their minds and understand their understand¬ 
ings. Mr. Van Doren did this by indirection. He 
reached us by paying attention, not to our triv¬ 
ial personalities, but to his subject and to the 
play of his own mind over his subject." 

Clifton Fadiman '25, the writer and editor, was a 
student of Mark Van Doren. 

Robert Giroux '36 

Mark Van Doren was not only a great teacher, 
but a leading Shakespearean scholar. It was in 
his Shakespeare classes that I met John 
Berryman '36, who became a poet because of 
Mark, went on to Clare, became the first 
American to win the Oldham Shakespeare 
prize, and later won the Pulitzer Prize and the 
National Book Award for his Dream Songs, 


which I published. Mark's unusual technique 
was to treat every student as his intellectual 
equal, forcing us to attain his level. 

He helped me personally in concrete ways: 
he found me an afternoon job at the Cinema de 
Paris on downtown Pifth Avenue, and, when I 
was a senior, he got my film reviews published 
in The Nation. Mark's influence extended to 
many generations of students—the monk-mys¬ 
tic Thomas Merton '38, the poet Robert Lax '38, 
the composer and playwright John Latouche 
'37, the painter Ad Reinhardt '35, the biograph¬ 
er Edward Rice '40 and many others. 

In the recent film Quiz Show, Paul Scofield 
bears a physical resemblance to Van Doren and 
does catch a sense of his integrity. (But that Van 
Doren picnic scene has Merton, a cloistered 
Trappist, wearing a Pranciscan habit, in Connec¬ 
ticut. Impossible! Instead, Mark and his wife 
Dorothy visited Tom in his Kentucky monastery.) 

Mark was the great teacher in my life, an 
influence I can never forget.

I became Mark Van Doren's student in the fall 
of 1938 as a freshman in his Humanities course. 
This was only the second year the course was 
offered, and there was such enthusiasm for it 
that even senior professors gladly participated. 
Prom the first I was captivated by Professor 
Van Doren. He spoke in simple language, com¬ 
pletely without affectation, and what gave his 
words special persuasiveness was that he 
seemed to be thinking all the time. He used no 
notes (let alone manuscripts), but spoke as if he 
had just made discoveries that he wanted to 
share. He asked questions frequently and man¬ 
aged always to make the students' responses, 
however inept, seem to contain at least a grain 
of insight. After hearing his lectures I always 
wanted to read the required books over again, 
and I did so with St. Augustine, after he had 
made me feel ashamed of my sophomoric first 
reading. 

In my junior year (1940-41) I took his 
Shakespeare course, another memorable experi¬ 
ence. Even now, after fifty years, my apprecia¬ 
tion of Shakespeare is still colored by his per¬ 
ceptions, what he taught me. Pinally, after the 
war, as a graduate student, I took his course on 
the long poem, which included Dante, Spenser, 
and Milton. In the meantime I had learned 
Japanese, and my term paper was a comparison 
of the hell imagined by Genshin, a tenth-centu¬ 
ry Japanese monk, and Dante. He wrote on the

Was Quiz Show 
on the money? 


T 


his is the happiest day of my life." That's what Mark Van 
Doren reportedly said when his son Charles told a 
stunned nation in 1959 that he had won $129,000 on the 
television game show Twenty-One after having been 
given the answers in advance. 

Whatever the elder Van Doren may have meant by his remark, the 
family's drama has been brought back to public consciousness by 
Robert Redford's acclaimed movie Quiz Show. The film had a special 
dimension for the Columbia community, whose reactions to it were 
strong. 

"I thought it was brilliant," said the critic Morris Dickstein '61 of 
Paul Scofield's performance. "It was so much like Mark Van Doren 
that it was eerie." In his New York Times Magazine column. Max 
Frankel '52 wrote that Messrs. Scofield and Redford "brilliantly 
reproduce the professor's rugged looks, refined diction and sunny 
classroom." (True, some alumni recalled that Van Doren pronounced 
"Don Quixote" as "Don kwix-ut," not "Don kee-ho-tay.") 

Less successful was Ralph Fiennes as Charles. One member of the 
Class of '59 who had the young Van Doren for Humanities A found 
Mr. Fiennes to be "a less worldly, more passive, even more childish, 
'golly-gosh' naive kind of person than the Charles Van Doren I knew. 
He was an authoritative, strong personality." And a popular one, too; 
when Columbia accepted his resignation, hundreds of students 
signed petitions and protested loudly. 

For some, the film evoked the exciting days on campus when televi¬ 
sion was still a novelty and Van Doren fils was, briefly, its biggest star. 
Former College Dean Robert E. Pollack '61 remembered cheering 
crowds watching Twenty-One on the 
black-and-white in Hartley lounge. 
"I thought this was the most roman¬ 
tic thing you could imagine—beat¬ 
ing some creepy guy [opponent 
Herb Stempel] in the name of 
Columbia." 

Current students generally 
found Quiz Show to be a revelation. 
Though Kara Finck '96 had a vague 



Paul Scofield as Mark Van Doren 


manuscript, "Genshin is 
interesting because so 
uninteresting." 

Mark Van Doren's 
influence on me was 
profound, perhaps most 
of all in my decision to 
lecture without notes. To 
the degree that I was a 
successful teacher I was 
imitating him; when 
unsuccessful, it was 
because I was not his 
equal.

I sat in Mark Van Doren's 
classes in the late 1940's, a dazzling time for an 
English major in Columbia College. The fourth 
floor of Hamilton Hall comprised at that time 
perhaps the most brilliant configuration of 
teacher-critics of literature ever assembled in a 
single English department. The most remark¬ 
able presence in that distinguished company 
belonged to Mark Van Doren. No other teacher 
I have known ever conveyed so abundantly or 
freshly the actual feel of an idea caught in 
flight. He did not teach a particular body of 
knowledge; rather he appeared to embody the 
act of thinking itself. He had a powerful athleti¬ 
cism of mind and loved to wrestle in public 
with paradox. Indeed, paradox was his peda¬ 
gogic medium. The irony of inquiry played 
over his handsome features as he spoke, and 
his resonant voice was transfixing. He never 
taught a conclusion, and once he had explored 
a subject, he left its further elaboration to oth¬ 
ers. He wrote a superb book on all of 
Shakespeare's poems and plays, then gave his 
famous Shakespeare course to a gifted junior 
colleague, Andrew Chiappe '33. Instinctively 
gracious and generous, he knew that the best 
teaching is not the exhibition of mastery but a 
joint and joyous inquiry, a shared quest. Only 
the very best of teachers—Moses Hadas also 
comes to mind—can reach all of those who 
have ears to hear; Mark Van Doren stretched 
the minds of athletes and future engineers, not 
only of aspiring poets and English professors. 

I arrived on the College scene too late for 
Van Doren's Shakespeare lectures but not for 
his new classes on Narrative Art, including the 
art of Shakespeare's contemporary, Cervantes. 
None of us who attended those classes will for¬ 
get certain moments, for they have entered the 
very fabric of our thought. I still hear echoes

from them half a century later, a scarcely audi¬ 
ble music that accompanies me when I walk 
into my Humanities class and we talk about 
Don Quixote's dreams of reality, and the reality 
of his dreams. 

In 1958, almost a decade after graduating, I 
heard Mark Van Doren give his farewell lecture, 
which happened also to be on Don Quixote. 1 
sat on the floor, in the aisle of an overcrowded

dents crowded into a single room or been wit¬

He stood by his desk

heads through the win¬

great names carved into 
the facade of Butler 
Library. Harris tweeds, 
elfin smile and that 
Gerald Weissmann '50 shock of hair! One foot 
was perched on the seat 
of an empty chair, his elbow propped on his 
knee. Chin in hand, he nibbled a piece of chalk, 
looked up at the sky, then turned to us and 
asked—apropos of Kafka at the time —"I wonder 
if we can call any imaginary act good or bad?" 1 
was not sure what he meant in the spring of 
1949, and I'm still not sure, but 1 remember 
thinking that 1 had watched a conversation 
among professionals, for it was not only as 
teacher but as poet that Van Doren had read the 
lines of Dante, Milton, Shakespeare—those 
names over Butler Library— with us. I knew 
then and there that one could do far worse than 
to spend one's life at a University where one is 
expected not only to teach well but to make 
something new. 

The author Gerald Weissmann '50 is professor of

Heads (Vintage). He is completing a biography of 
Lewis Thomas. Dr. Weissmann studied with Mark 
Van Doren in each of his years at Columbia.

acquaintance with the scandal as an historical event, the two friends 
she saw the film with did not—and none of them had known of 
Columbia's role. 

But Quiz Show was also criticized for what many thought to be bad 
history. Congressional investigator Richard Goodwin is depicted as 
exposing the scandal almost singlehandedly; virtually ignored is the 
nine-month investigation by assistant Manhattan D.A. Joseph Stone 
under District Attorney Frank Hogan '24. And in showing how Judge 
Mitchell Schweitzer '26 refused to release the grand jury's present¬ 
ment, the film suggests he was in league with the producers of 
Twenty-One —an impression countered by Dr. Daniel Schweitzer '62, 
who defends his father's decision that he was not legally authorized 
to release a report that found no evidence of any crime. 

Many viewers have wondered why the Columbia portions of the 
movie were shot at Fordham. Don Sauvigne, Director of Buildings and 
Grounds Services, acknowledged that while the scandal was still embar¬ 
rassing to the University, permission to film might have been granted 
("reluctantly") had not production threatened to disrupt classes. 

For his own part, Charles Van Doren, who today lives in Connec¬ 
ticut, has made no public comment. After his unfortunate moment in 
the spotlight was over, he worked for many years on the Encyclopedia 
Britannica and other endeavors under family friend Mortimer J. Adler 
'23. In a rare 1988 interview with Lester Bernstein '40 for Memories 
magazine, he said of the scandal, "I don't think about it. Perhaps I've 
sealed it out of my mind."

John the Divine, as a gift from the 
government of Czechoslovakia. 
He was also a former violinist 
with the New York Philharmonic.

Louis M. Nizer, lawyer. New 
York, N.Y., on November 10, 

1994. Combining masterful ora¬ 
tory with a command of court¬ 
room procedure, Mr. Nizer won 
international fame as a trial attor¬ 
ney, representing the powerful 
and the humble in many highly 
publicized cases. The senior part¬ 
ner of the New York firm of 
Phillips, Nizer, Benjamin, Krim & 
Ballon, which he co-founded two 
years after he graduated from the 
Law School in 1924, Mr. Nizer 
specialized in entertainment law: 
his clients included Charlie 
Chaplin, Mae West, Salvador 
Dali, Alan Jay Lerner, Johnny 
Carson, and the Motion Picture 
Association of America, of which 
he was general counsel. Perhaps 
V his best-known case was the libel 

suit of the CBS broadcaster John 
Henry Faulk in 1962 against the 
right-wing organization AWARE, 
which had branded him a com¬ 
munist; the $3.5 million judgment 
against AWARE effectively ended 
blacklisting in the industry. Mr. 
Nizer also successfully repre¬ 
sented the journalist Quentin 
Reynolds in his suit against the 
columnist Westbrook Pegler, a 
confrontation later immortalized 
in the Broadway drama A Case of 
Libel. Mr. Nizer was active in 
Democratic politics, advising 
Presidents and other major fig¬ 
ures. A brilliant aphorist and 
toastmaster, he sought to convey 
the excitement and majesty of the 
law in the 10 books he wrote.

Our Class President William 
Treiber and his wife Betty spent 
three months last summer in 
Yerevan, the capital of Armenia. 
Bill served as a volunteer advisor 


to the chairman of the newly 
established central bank. Betty 
kept busy teaching classes in con¬ 
versational English. "Moving 
from a deteriorated central-com¬ 
mand economy to a market-ori¬ 
ented economy has been difficult 
for Armenia," Bill writes. 

During the years of Soviet rule, 
buildings in the center of Yerevan 
were torn down and replaced 
with modern buildings of tufa 
stone. The modernized central 
square of handsome buildings 
was dominated by a huge statue 
of Lenin. Many parks, fountains 
and factory buildings made for a 
memorable showcase city for visi¬ 
tors from within the Soviet Union 
as well as from abroad. Bill writes 
that decay has set in since the fall 
of the Soviet Union and many 
factories have closed. There is a 
shortage of electricity, much 
unemployment and a large deficit 
in Armenia today. 

The late Elie Siegmeister was 
honored at a recital of his music 
at the Ethical Culture Society in 
Manhattan on May 22. The pro¬ 
gram, which included blues, bal¬ 
lads, and ragtime compositions, 
reflected Siegmeister's close rela¬ 
tionship to the poet Langston 
Hughes '25. The evening's offer¬ 
ings were praised by the New 
York Times music critic, who 
wrote that Siegmeister was a 
"skillful composer who looked 
around his America and com¬ 
posed music about what he saw." 

In an August 10 letter to the 
editor, Robert C. Schnitzer 
responded to a New York Times 
article about three decades of FBI 
surveillance of Leonard Bernstein 
and related his own experience 
with Bernstein as an administra¬ 
tor for the State Department's 
international cultural exchange 
program. 

Joe Crown, as a member of the 
Lawyers Committee on Nuclear 
Policy, has joined the debate over 
"The Last Act: The Atomic Bomb 
and the End of World War II," the 
exhibit planned at the Smith¬ 
sonian's National Air and Space 
Museum in Washington next May. 
Writing at some length to the edi¬ 
tor of The Nation, Joe points to the 
evidence accumulated over the 
years "that the primary reason for 
bombing Hiroshima and Nagasaki 
was not to end the war in Japan, as 
was said at the time, but to make 
the Russians more manageable."

Homecoming 1994 was again 
blessed with beautiful, sunny fall 
weather as you can only get in the 
Big Apple. And, as things turned 
out, excellent football weather. In 
the event you have not heard, 
Columbia beat Princeton handily. 

Present at the 30's table were: 
class prez Joe Moukad with wife 
Anne; Stan Brams, all the way 
from Detroit on the way to winter 
in Spain, and the Reillys. (I was 
an O'Reilly until the time my 
father "got off the boat" and was 
advised to drop the O' to enhance 
his employability.) The table was 
marked for the 30's so there were 
some "younger" people present, 
but for the first time, no Charlie? 

Fortunately Doris later 
received a letter from Judge 
Charles Metzner with regard to 
some contributions to the 
Columbia College Thrift Shop on 
Park Avenue South. After 35 
years on the bench he felt that it 
was time for a new lifestyle so he 
and wife Jeanne decided to for¬ 
sake the big city. Henceforth, they 
will spend winters in Sarasota, 
Fla. and summers in upstate New 
York. Except for an odd assign¬ 
ment here and there, his active 
judicial days are over. Charlie 
had not previously missed any 
home football game since our 
freshman year, but the commute 
from Sarasota was a little much. 

A typed—or is it word- 
processed?—note from Stan 
Brams (you may remember he 
abandoned his old typewriter) 
regarding his further travels, this 
time to Canada. On a trip down 
from Labrador to the highway 
adjoining the St. Lawrence River, 
he stopped off, as was his wont, 
to visit an antique shop near 
Cornwall. Here he discovered a 
copy of the February 1929 Jester 
along with a program from the 
1932 Varsity Show. Jester con¬ 
tained an illustration and some 
verse from none other than 
Remey Tys, our old classmate of 
basketball and football fame. Also 
the usual articles by Barney 
Dougal. Stan wrote that he did 
not know Remey was a "littera¬ 
teur" (sic). He must have forgot¬ 
ten. On this trip he must have 
traveled without a "splendid 
guide," as in Vietnam. He tripped 
in a parking lot in Bare Comeau, 
cracking several ribs. 

Another goof! Received a two- 
page letter from John Kilgore 
chiding me again for failure to 


distinguish between a dancer 
and a bowler. John, and not his 
brother and classmate Joe 
'Kilgore (the bowler), was present 
with his wife Jeanne at the 1994 
Dean's Day. John (the dancer), 
who lives in nearby River Edge, 
N.J., attends Dean's Day on a 
fairly regular basis while Joe has 
not left his South Jersey habita¬ 
tion for the New York scene in 
quite a while. John and Jeanne go 
ballroom dancing once or twice a 
week; it's great exercise. Last 
March they spent a week in 
Bermuda with a dance group 
from Canada and they still do 
Elderhostel programs. Last year 
they spent 26 great days in 
Ireland studying Irish history, 
including five days at the home 
of a young couple with two chil¬ 
dren. Next May: two weeks in an 
Elderhostel program in England 
called "History of English 
Gardens." For a change, this win¬ 
ter: some time with relatives in 
Florida, winding up on a 
Caribbean cruise on Arthur 
Smith's favorite ship, the 
Sagafjord. 

Doris recently received word 
from Dea that the Arthur Smiths 
are pleased with their digs in 
Delray Beach and do not miss the 
good exercise of climbing 11 
flights of stairs on occasion. 

Doris just became a great¬ 
grandmother. Any other great- 
grandparents? Travel stories? 
Don't just sit there, tell us about 
it whilst time permits!

Time marches on—autumn into 
another rugged winter—^but 
what can you do? Our class is 
still functioning—those of us 
who are left—so I bring you the 
following bits of information: 

An article in The New York 
Times in September on home 
videos noted that the old movie 
Forever Amber (1947) is being 
released as a home video. The 
reason it is of interest to us is that 
one of its stars is Cornel Wilde. I 
never knew him, but records 
indicate that he was indeed a 
member of our class. 

Received a note from Abe 
Workman, who looks back 
fondly on the expansion of vision 
that his education at Columbia 
gave him. Wonderful tribute. 

Please, please get me any 
information you might have 


about yourself or other members 
of the class so I can continue to 
write this column.

Julian Bush organized and 
chaired the Medical University of 
South Carolina's First Annual 
Estate Planning Institute last May 
in Charleston. Co-sponsored by 
the state bar association, it fea¬ 
tured a roster of nationally 
known speakers and a sold-out 
house. Julian is now lining up 
speakers for the 1995 Institute, 
which will be held May 12-13 in 
Charleston. He is also taking, 
with his wife, Bette, a master's 
degree program in bioethics. "As 
any good Columbian will tell 
you, you never forget how to 
study," he writes. 

On June 8,1994, Will Midonick 
was guest of honor at a dinner at 
the Pierre Hotel in New York City, 
sponsored by the Lawyers 
Division for the UJA-Federation. 

An article in Newsday last 
August noted: "Herman Wouk 
and Jimmy Buffett might become 
Broadway's newest odd couple. 
Wouk and Buffett are expected to 
begin work in November on a 
musical based on Wouk's 1965 
novel Don't Stop the Carnival. It's 
about a press agent who buys an 
island hotel, seeking paradise." 

Arnold Beichman, former edi¬ 
tor of the Columbia Spectator, 
writes from California that he is 
in his 13th year at the Hoover 
Institution, Stanford University, 
and his 12th year as a regular 
columnist for the Washington 
Times. He points out that his 
name was omitted from the list 
of attendees at the 60th Reunion. 
The list was furnished by the 
College Reunion Committee, and 
we regret the omission.

Sidney Breitbart was awarded the

Hebrew University last year. He

At the age of 85, the distinguished 
conductor and violist Milton 
Katims '30 still maintains an 
active schedule. His 1994 itinerary 
included an appearance with the 
University of Washington orches¬ 
tra, performing and teaching at the 
Victoria (B.C.) International Music 
Festival, and playing with the Tre 
Voce Trio. Maestro Katims also had 
several guest conducting engage¬ 
ments, including one with the 
Seattle Symphony, which he served 
as music director for 22 years. 
"Continuing to conduct at my age 
is not unusual—the longevity of 
conductors is well known," he 
writes. "However, continuing to 
play the viola is unusual. But, as 
long as I find joy in making music 
with my instrument, I will keep 
right on playing." 

Once called "the Pablo Casals 
of the viola," Mr. Katims was 
first desk violist for 10 years 
under Toscanini, who chose him 
as principal guest conductor of 
the NBC Orchestra for more than 
50 coast-to-coast broadcasts. A 
former member of the Juilliard 
faculty, he has performed and 
conducted on five continents, 
transcribed and edited more than 
three dozen works for the viola, 
and recorded for Columbia, RCA, 
Vox, and Pantheon. Mr. Katims's 
wife, Virginia, is an accomplished 
cellist who has played chamber 
music with Isaac Stern and the 
Budapest String Quartet.

the early 1960's his association with 
what was then Baltimore Hebrew 
College began the seeds of his con¬ 
tinued attendance, and diligent 
study ripened into fruits of articles 
in nationally known Jewish publi¬ 
cations, and his own book that is to 
appear this year: The Challenge of 
God to Man: A Theology of 
Responsible Freedom. This book is 
the summation of a philosophy of 
life which understands the

Bill Sitterly writes from 
Naples, Fla. that he is still very 
active in Habitat for Humanity, as 
he has been since 1979; they have 
put up more than 125 houses in 
the Immokalee and East Naples 
area. In addition, his son Bill Jr. 

'74 is now serving a three-year 
commitment as an international 
partner for Habitat, building 
homes in Papua, New Guinea. 

Bill is active in the Columbia 
University Club of Southeast 
Florida. He and wife Catharine 
just celebrated their 54th wed¬ 
ding anniversary. As a further 
"extra-curricular" activity, he has 
just been called back to serve a 
three-year term on the session of 
his local Presbyterian Church.

Let me know if you would like to 
attend an informal reunion party, 
probably to be held in Sardi's 
restaurant some evening this 
summer. A number of us, chiefly 
active classmates in the N.Y. met¬ 
ropolitan area, held a party in 
September and agreed that an 
annual get-together would be a 
fine idea. 

Among those present were 
George Ames, Charles Baldini, 
Bob Barnes, Murray Bloom, 

Jim Casey, Carl Desch, Anton 
Doblmaier, Jim Dunaway's 
widow, Ed Fischetti, Harry 
Friedman, Larry Gussman, Gene 
Kalil, John Kluge, Bob McMillen, 
Vince Merendino, Frank Michel, 
Don O'Connell, Kermit Pines, 

Bill Roveto, Vince Sardi, Wally 
Schaap, and Randy Seifert. 

We may all be getting on in 
years, but we're not too old to be 
doing things and winning honors: 

Murray Bloom, for instance, was 
named 1^4 Magazine Professional 
of the Year by the Association for 
Education in Journalism and Mass 
Communication, the first writer to 
be so honored. 

Danny Kayfetz, now a retired 
orthopedic surgeon, was honored 
as "Artist of the Month" by his 
Cahfomia community for his sculp¬ 
ture, medical illustrations, and 
watercolors. He currently teaches 
ceramic sculpture to seniors. 

After exhaustive research, 
Charles Marshall, a captain in 
military intelligence in W. W. II, 
has written Discovering the 
Rommel Murder, published by 
Stackpole Books. 

Dr. Irby Stephens's score on a 
recent round of golf was less 
than his age. Nine holes, of 
course. Irby recently started a 
world cruise, flying to Athens to 
board the boat. Got only as far as 
Crete before the boat broke 
down. Came right back home 
where he had a Thanksgiving 


reunion with Bob Barnes. 

Vince Cieri, recovered from 
bypass surgery, now enjoys chair¬ 
ing a board which awards college 
scholarships to promising high 
school students in Monmouth 
County, N.J. 

Our far-flung correspondents: We 
recently heard from Max Norman in 
Australia, Fred Salinger in Arizona, 
George Gardiner in California, and 
Lynn Beeler in Greece.

John E Crymble, Leonard Luhby, 
and Paul Taub attended the 
College Scholarship reception on 
Morningside. Wally Roath reports 
that he is still active in Dallas. 

Russ Zeininger reports from 
Los Angeles that the late Ralph J. 
Gleason (1917-1975) is still rec¬ 
ognized as an original student 
and writer about the develop¬ 
ment of jazz music in the years 
after World War 11. 

Ralph de Toledano's "classic" 
anthology Frontiers of Jazz (first 
published in 1947) has been reis¬ 
sued by Pelican Publishing Co. of 
Gretna, La. He has also pub¬ 
lished a second book of verse.

Brooklyn's Erasmus Hall High 
School has named its football 
field for Sid Luckman and dedi¬ 
cated it to him. Sid was quarter¬ 
back for the Columbia Lions and 
the Chicago Bears and is a mem¬ 
ber of both the college and pro 
football halls of fame. 

Ralph Staiger has been elected 
to the executive committee of the 
International Board of Books for 
Young People. This organization, 
headquartered in Basel, Switzerland, 
is an international network of peo¬ 
ple who are dedicated to bringing 
books and children together. 
William Hutchins writes from 
Chapel Hill that he is developing the 
Triangle Free-Net, a free, nonprofit 
public computer information and 
discussion system for the Research 
Triangle section of North Carolina. 

Ed Schortman notes that 
"since my retirement, beginning 
in 1975,1 have been teaching my 
profession (medicine) in the Third 
World, including Indonesia, 
Afghanistan and Pakistan, under 
the aegis of CARE." Robert 
Lockwood is a member of the 
American Arbitration Association 
Panel of Arbitrators. Now retired, 
he is an active volunteer at a hos¬

Attention! In case you misplaced 
Lawson Bernstein's November 
letter: Mark down the weekend 
of June 2-4,1995 in your appoint¬ 
ment book. It's the date of our 
on-campus 55th Reunion! 

Your class officers have been 
actively organizing to assure 
that—with your help—this will 
prove an even more smashing 
success than our 50th, which 
drew 130 celebrants. 

Stan Temko chaired a nomi¬ 
nating committee for class offi¬ 
cers to be elected at the reunion; 
the slate includes all current class 
officers plus Hector Dowd to 
succeed Lawson as president and 
Russ Tandy to succeed Hector as 
executive vice-president. 

Lawson appointed himself and 
Hector as reunion co-chairs and 
named a reunion committee (in 
formation) that includes Jim Bruce, 
Dan Edelman, Bill Feinberg, 

Herb Kayden, Harry Kosovsky, 
Don Kursch, Mel Inter, Jack 
Naylor, Seth Neugroschl, Stan 
Temko, Phil Thurston, and 
Charlie Webster. Ellis Gardner 
will be the honorary chair. 
University President George Rupp 
is expected to attend the class 
cocktail reception on Saturday, 
June 3. 

Topics for the Saturday morn¬ 
ing seminars are "Women and the 
Future" and "Communication." 

Fundamental changes in 
how—and what—we communi¬ 
cate are at the heart of predic¬ 
tions of the future impact of the 
national information infrastruc¬ 
ture on our culture and lives. 
Early, exciting examples of such 
impacts on research, teaching 
and learning are already visible 
on the Columbia campus. 

The remarkably changing roles 
of women worldwide since our 
graduation are admirably 
reflected in the College's compo¬ 
sition: women actually slightly 
outnumber men in the class of 
1998. We hope to reflect this in 
our own reunion planning, and 
to encourage full participation of 
wives or significant others, as 
they choose, in all Reunion 
events. Lawson has asked to 
have Don Kursch introduce his 
granddaughter, Catherine Kursch 
'95, at our reunion. He hopes that 
Cathy will address us briefly at 
one of the events. To quote 
Lawson: "The old practice of 
having wives go off to flower 
shows or pursue 'cultural' inter¬ 
ests while men attend the 'real' 
reunion events has long since 
passed." 

Bob Lubar, who was the man¬ 
aging editor and genius behind 
Fortune magazine, has had med¬ 


ical problems which make it 
impossible for him to travel to 
our 55th Reunion. He will be 
with us there in spirit because he 
has agreed to serve, in absentia, 
on the reunion committee. 

Lawson says that we'll have a 
vacant chair at our Saturday, June 
3 dinner, both for Bob and as a 
symbol of our absent classmates. 

Charlie Webster and Lawson 
were together at the recent 
Hamilton Award Dinner honoring 
the core curriculum professors 
and talked about our upcoming 
reunion... Herb Kayden is busy 
with important medical research 
on Vitamin E... I'm continuing my 
focus on exploring the common 
ground for networked multi- 
media across many areas of appli¬ 
cation—in and out of academia... 
When Jim Bruce received our 
invitation to serve on the reunion 
committee he wrote from his hos¬ 
pital bed, recuperating from major 
surgery, that he would try to 
attend all the committee meetings 
as soon as his health permitted. 
That's class spirit! We hope Jim is 
on the mend. 

Looking forward to seeing you 
at the 55th!

From Arnold Hoffman comes 
word of the Columbia University 
Alumni Club of the Palm Beaches, 
of which he is president. A recent 
meeting featured Dean Mary O. 
Mundinger of the School of 
Nursing, who spoke on health 
care reform. Arnold continues to 
practice law in Florida. 

From Art Weinstock comes 
news of an impressive class 
turnout at the Homecoming game 
against Princeton: Helen and Fred 
Abdoo, Mary Louise and Hugh 
Barber, Peggy and Bill Batiuchok, 
Semmes Clark, Joe Coffee, Ted

Homecoming regular, Quentin 
Brown was unable to attend 
owing to recent major vascular 
surgery. We wish him well. We 
also note that George Geanuracos 
is said to be doing well following 
a pacemaker implantation in May.

Fifty-three years after he first graduated from Columbia, Special 
Service Professor Wm. Theodore de Bary '41 commenced anew last 
May when he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree. It 
read in part, "[Y]ou have built a career of incomparable attainment 
and loyal devotion to Columbia. The core values of your Columbia 
College education became the foundation of your life's work: to make 
East Asian thought and culture a focus of humanistic research and to 
move Asian studies into the core of general education." 

Considered the leading Western scholar of Confucianism, Mr. 
de Bary has written 23 books, including the source books for the 
University's Oriental Studies program, which he established in 1953. 
Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost from 
1971 to 1978, he currently directs the Senior Scholars Program 
whereby retired professors continue to teach their specialties. His 
lifetime of service to the University, as well as his devotion to his 
class, was recognized when the Wm. Theodore and Fanny Brett de 
Bary and Class of 1941 Collegiate Professorship of Asian Humanities 
was created in 1991. 

Few can match Mr. de Bary's immersion in the Light Blue. Such is 
the extent of his association with the College—former chairman of 
the Student Board and manager of the Debate Council, winner of the 
Lionel Trilling, Mark Van Doren, Great Teacher, and John Jay 
Awards, a lifelong supporter of athletics—that some of his ties (like 
his membership in the Philolexian Society, which, he says dryly, "I 
have no reason to repudiate") have only lately emerged. Indeed, 
Professor de Bary affirmed his honorary place in the Class of '94 by 
marching with the College's graduates at Class Day.

for our 50th Reunion? 

I want to highlight the Class of 
1945 Reunion from June 2-4 in 
1995. Registration is on Friday 
from noon to 8 p.m. and the

Sunday with an all-class buffet 
breakfast. Come for all or part of 
the reunion, but do come. 

I am looking at a list of those

at work with the Columbia staff, 
and this reunion will be out¬ 
standing. Reunion date cards

fill in for you for this event. Your 
presence will assure the success 
of what promises to be a memo¬ 
rable event. 

Our honorees this time are all 
the guys and gals who attended 
the 45th Reunion. We hope to see 
all of you and many more at the 
50th.

A note from Stan Schechter 
reports that he retired after 42 
years from Rohm and Haas Co. 
where he was engineering man¬ 
ager on safety, health and envi¬ 
ronment. Stan is continuing to 
live in Willingboro, N.J. Bernie 
Sunshine checked in with a 
report that he joined Harry 
Garbett at the Reunion tent at 
Homecoming. "Harry looks great 
and continues to practice den¬ 
tistry in Elmira." Once again our 
regular newsmaker Fritz Stern is 
in the limelight, having been 
elected to Germany's Orden Pour 
le Merite fur Wissenschaften und 
Kiinste. In this historic honor soci¬ 
ety he joins seven Nobel laureates 
and other international leaders in 
the arts and sciences. At least 
Fritz will be able to pronounce 
the title. Your class secretary had 
lunch with John Murphy and 
Walt McVicar recently, planning 
the 50th Reunion of the 1945 crew 
squad. Both looked in top form 
and are ready to hit the Harlem 
River again. 

To follow up on the reunion, I 
saw Ed Taylor while in Ponte 
Vedra, Fla. Ed found that playing 
golf was not enough so he volun¬ 
teered at the Mayo Clinic in that 
area. He dons a blue jacket and is 
currently at the information desk. 
His aim is to become a jitney dri¬ 
ver around the huge parking lot. 
One way or another, he will be 
"driving." Lucien Carr made the 
papers in connection with a 
review of his son Caleb's best 
seller. The Alienist. Caleb recalled 
that his father, along with Jack 
Kerouac '44 and Allen Ginsberg 
'48, "basically were very loud 
people who were drunk most of 
the time." Ah the memories of 
our children! 

A call from Old Faithful, 
Howard Clifford, added to his 
sordid record. Howard is now in 
Lonely Palm, Idaho, where he is 
growing coconuts for his pifia 
colada stand on Route 24. No 
matter how busy he is, Howard 
keeps up with his classmates, 
reporting that Dick Heffner has 
finally retired as chairman of 
the classification board which 
assigned PG, R and X ratings to 
thousands of films. Howard tried 
to get Dick to give a PG rating to a 


script he had written. Apparently 
the final rating was a Z. Before the 
rest of you start Z-ing, how about 
a line or two for the next column.

Two news items are at hand— 
more a trickle than a flood, but 
showing that the pipeline has not 
rusted beyond all utility. 

The first comes from Alfred J. 
Casagrande, from Matawan, N.J., 
who reports that he has retired 
after 40 years of general medical 
practice in his hometown but 
continues his active participation 
as vice president of the board of 
trustees of the local hospital. His 
eight adult children and seven 
grandchildren are "all doing 
well"—keeping track must be a 
full-time job. A1 also mentions 
that he periodically gets together 
with Dave Chafey '46, Bill Brown 
'46 and Andy Furey '44, all mem¬ 
bers of the same profession, for 
golf and other non-invasive 
activities. 

Our second epistle comes from 
Pierre L. Sales, who finished 
roaming the world and settled 
down in Great Falls, Va. Pierre 
announces that he is putting the 
final touches on a five-volume (!) 
"mini-encyclopedia" on the his¬ 
tory of Africa. Sounds like the 
research tool on the region, and it 
should be of inestimable value to ' 
our own and other college 
libraries. 

So much for this issue. We 
look forward to the next one in 
the hope, not necessarily vain, 
that the next '47 column will be 
longer.

Burt Sax proudly announces the 
arrival of Leah Ashley Sax, first 
granddaughter, joining three 
grandsons already in the fold 
(total, four, for non-math majors). 
Burt reports that he is mostly 
retired, traveling and enjoying 
life, and occasionally catching 
one of Dick Hyman's regular 
spots on Long Island's WQEW 
(1560 AM). 

Dick recently found himself in 
the middle of an unscheduled '48 
mini-reunion hosted by Jim 
Nugent, following a performance 
by Dick and longtime collabora¬ 
tor Derek Smith at New York's 
University Club. Also in atten¬ 
dance: Bob Graf, John Steeves, 
your class correspondent, and 
near-'48ers A1 Baker '47, John 
Deignan '49, Lee Houston and 
Fritz Larsen. 

Dr. Bob Silbert, still a practicing 


psychiatrist in New York, writes 
that "managed care certainly 
impacts this field, perhaps too 
much." Both Silbert daughters are 
now married. "No grandchildren 
yet!" says Bob. "I keep hinting." 

Donald A. Senhauser, M.D. 
was named Pathologist of the 
Year by the College of American 
Pathologists at its fall meeting in 
Washington. Responding to the 
award. Dr. Senhauser stated, 

"The opportunity to serve this 
remarkable professional society 
has been the ultimate joy of a 
career that now spans 43 years." 
Prior to that, we presume, it was 
the Army-Columbia game of 
1947. (How about them Lions?) 

Activity surrounding the 50th 
anniversary of the D-Day invasion 
of France brought about renewed 
interest in the poem "Carentan 
O Carentan," written by Louis 
Simpson in 1949 as a recollection 
of his own experience in that oper¬ 
ation. Professor Simpson, a native 
of the island of Jamaica and a 
Pulitzer Prize winner for poetry in 
1964, retired in 1993 after a distin¬ 
guished career at the State 
University at Stony Brook. 

Nine years ago, poet Allen 
Ginsberg noted in the introduc¬ 
tion to his Collected Poems 
1947-1986 that he was creating 
material directed to "electronic 
laser TV generations that don't 
read Dostoyevsky." Long an 
advocate of the spoken word as a 
medium for poetry, Allen is in 
the forefront of such public per¬ 
formance, which has been gain¬ 
ing recently in popularity. Taking 
one step further, Allen has now 
introduced a four-CD set. Holy 
Soul Jelly Roll: Songs and Poems 
(1948-1993), which includes his 
first reading of the landmark 
poem "Howl." 

All right you non-Dostoyevsky- 
readers out there... go for it.

Regrettably and inadvertently 
omitted from the list of '49 
reunion attendees in the last col¬ 
umn were Sue and Howard 
Beldoch. This is especially 
embarrassing as Howard played 
a prominent part in planning the 
reunion and was in large part 
responsible for its success. 

Our new class president, 
Joseph Levie, has sent out a ques¬ 
tionnaire to assist in planning for 
our 50th Anniversary Reunion in 
'99. Please help by responding as 
early as you can, as much will 
depend on your input. 

Mention was made at our 45th 
Reunion dinner of the then- 
impending 50th anniversary of 
the Normandy invasion, and we 
observed a moment of silence in 


honor of the many American sol¬ 
diers, sailors and airmen who 
were killed or wounded in that 
operation. George Brehm was 
afterwards moved to recall to 
your correspondent his own role 
in the affair as radioman/gunner 
aboard a B-26 medium bomber in 
the 9th (tactical) Air Force based 
in England. They had flown three 
"softening-up" missions just 
prior to D-Day, including bomb¬ 
ing attacks on several bridges 
outside of Paris. On D-Day itself 
they flew two combat missions, 
the first before dawn and the sec¬ 
ond later that same day, targeting 
enemy positions just inshore of 
the invasion beaches. Twenty 
additional missions quickly fol¬ 
lowed in close support of the 
invasion against railroad stations, 
bridges, ammunition dumps and 
Nazi troop concentrations at 
Caen, Cherbourg, St. L6, the Pas 
de Calais area and outlying areas 
of Paris. For this activity George 
was awarded the Air Medal and 
three Oak Leaf Clusters. On 
August 7, 1944, a day that 
George was off duty, his aircraft 
was shot down by ground fire 
with the loss of its entire crew 
while en route to St. L6. 

Classmates, your wartime ser¬ 
vice reminiscences are solicited 
for recounting in this space. 

Richard Cram writes that he is 
enjoying retirement but gives no 
details. 

In an Op-Ed piece in The New 
York Times for September 12, 
Charles Peters refers to Sen. 
Gramm, Rep. Gingrich and Sen. 
Dole as "today's Martin, Barton 
and Fish, whom [we] will remem¬ 
ber as the three Republicans most 
dedicated to obstructing [the 
President's] efforts to prepare the 
nation for World War 11." 

Essays in Humanistic Mathematics, 
edited by Alvin White, was pub¬ 
lished in October 1993 by the Math 
Association of America as MAA 
Notes #32. Alvin notes that he 
also publishes The Humanistic 
Mathematics Network Journal, avail¬ 
able free by writing him at Harvey 
Mudd College, Claremont, Calif. 
91711. 

On a somber note, and these 
will inexorably and regrettably 
occur as the years pass, we 
express our deepest sorrow at the 
news of Justin D'Atri's bereave¬ 
ment. His beloved wife Doris 
waged a gallant seven-year battle 
against severe illness. To Justin, 
sincere condolences and heartfelt 
wishes for better times. 

Ed Carranza writes from 
Tucson that he regrets not having 
made many friends while at col¬ 
lege, as he was considerably 
older than most and usually 
commuted from his home in 
New Jersey. Now 73, he and his 
lovely Mexican wife of 37 have a

14-year-old son. He asks particu¬ 
larly about Dick von Glatz, 
whom he last saw in Chicago 
some years back, and sends a 
copy (unfortunately not of 
reprint quality) of a snapshot 
made in or about '48 in which 
one can recognize Dale Golver, 
Charlie Marquard, Ed Rimer 
and Bob Rosencrans, all dignity 
and propriety. For a copy, or for 
info on sunny Arizona, write Ed 
at 8040 East Broadway, #106C, 
Tucson, Ariz. 85710. 

Dick Miller, who surprised us 
all at the June reunion, has been 
named Apple Grower of the Year 
for his crop of Fujis, Galas, Reds 
and Grannies, and observes that 
it certainly paid off to have gone 
to Columbia and majored in 
Apple Polishing. The award is 
(says he, so help me) the func¬ 
tional equivalent of a Nobel 
Prize. He offers to help with our 
next planned event, whether it be 
in 2049 or some other year. 

With great regret, we note in 
the Chronicle of Higher Education 
the untimely loss of Maurice 
Auslander, professor of math at 
Brandeis, who died in Trondheim, 
Norway, on November 18.

Hold open these dates: June 2-4, 
1995, for the Class of 1950's 45th 
Anniversary Reunion. A commit¬ 
tee of your classmates has been 
working since last fall to plan for 
a stimulating, memorable week¬ 
end for us. We'll have events and 
meals for our class exclusively, as 
well as all-class social activities. 
Circle that weekend on your cal¬ 
endar; you'll be getting more 
details. 

Sad news on the death of Jack 
Kelleher, in December 1993. Jack 
had retired a year earlier but 
unfortunately had heart prob¬ 
lems. Word about Jack came from 
Bud Kassel, who said also that 
he has been able to see Jean and 
Glenn Lubash at least once a 
year since the 40th Reunion. 
Glenn, who has "retired" but at 
last word was still working in 
medicine, is in Phoenix, Ariz. 

Ray Scalettar has been 
awarded two honors. The 
Houston Academy of Medicine 
selected Ray for the prestigious 
1994 John P. McGovern Compleat 
Physician Award. The SUNY 
Health Science Center at 
Brooklyn, Ray's alma mater, 
awarded him an honorary Doctor 
of Science degree for his "com¬ 
mitment to improving the public 
health, the quality of American 
medical care, and the climate in 
which physicians practice." Ray, 
who is in Washington, D.C., com¬ 
pleted a term in 1993 as chairman 


of the board of the American 
Medical Association. 

Phil Springer produced his own 
musical, A Song Floating, at a the¬ 
ater in Greenwich Village. It was 
a tough challenge, Phil says, but 
he felt that it was a case of do or 
die for his songs, so he did. Must 
be that old Varsity Show spirit. 
The show ran last November and 
December. Phil is based in Pacific 
Palisades, Calif. 

Heard from Bill Trimpin, who 
reports he has been retired from 
the CIA since 1990 and is in 
Washington, D.C. Bill spent 35 
years at the agency, where he 
studied Soviet military and naval 
construction. Bill says he has 
been living on boats for 15 years 
and has twice been commodore 
of the Capital Yacht Club.

Immanuel Wallerstein, distin¬ 
guished professor of sociology at 
SUNY-Binghamton and director 
of the school's Fernand Braudel 
Center for the Study of Econ¬ 
omics, Historical Systems and 
Civilizations, has been elected 
president of the International 
Sociological Association for the 
period 1994-98. Congratulations, 
Immanuel. Your outstanding 
accomplishments reflect credit 
not only on yourself, but on 
Columbia College as well. 

Congratulations also to Peter 
Suzuki, who teaches public 
administration at the University of 
Nebraska, Omaha. Based upon his 
accomplishments in research, he 
has been reappointed Frederick W. 
Kayser Professor for an additional 
three years. 

Alan Wagner, president of 
Boardwalk Entertainment, is a 
successful TV producer. This past 
year he put together a quartet of 
TV movies for Lifetime and ABC 
which were based on the Spenser 
detective novels by Robert 
Brooks. Prior to becoming an 
independent producer, Alan was 
the first president and CEO of the 
Disney Channel. His top assis¬ 
tants include his wife Marti, head 
of the story department, and 
daughters Susan and Liz, who are 
programmers in their own right. 
The Wagners have a son, David, 
who is a lawyer. He and his wife 
Kathy have a "production" com¬ 
pany of their own: turning out 
Alan's four lovely grandsons! 

Les Tanzer, retired managing 
editor of U.S. News & World 
Report, is living in Arlington, Va. 
With the four sons all married 
and out of the house, Les and his 
wife Marlene have the time (and 
money!) to travel. Erance is one 
of their favorite places. 

For the past 30 years. Herb 



Lester Baker '51, director of the 
pediatric endocrinology division 
at the Children's Hospital of 
Philadelphia, has received the 
Outstanding Clinician in 
Diabetes Award of the American 
Diabetes Association. A specialist 
in the care of children with the 
disease. Dr. Baker has recently 
devoted his attention to the 
evolution of microvascular com¬ 
plications of insulin-dependent 
diabetes mellitus in children 
and adolescents. 

A 1959 graduate of Columbia 
P&S, Dr. Baker has for many 
years taught pediatrics at the 
University of Pennsylvania, 
where he is a key member of 
the medical school's Diabetes 
Research Center. The author of 
some 90 scientific papers, he 
was the principal investigator 
of the Philadelphia Center for 
the National Institutes of 
Health's Diabetes Control and 
Complications Trial. He is 
married to the former Leisel 
Gutman and has two children. 


Beardsley has been the rector of 
the Episcopal Church of Advent 
in Westbury, N.Y. With retirement 
approaching. Herb and his wife 
Carolyn are looking at a bucolic 
hamlet on the North Shore. There 
are four children in the Beardsley 
family. All are married, gainfully 
employed. Including spouses, the 
group comprises a legal secre¬ 
tary, a teacher, two lawyers, an 
insurance broker, an author, a 
librarian and an MBA student. To 
quote Herb, "I'm counting on 
them to keep the Social Security 
Trust Fund solvent." 

Class president Bob Snyder, 
along with Dave Berman, 
attended the 1994 Alexander 
Hamilton Award Dinner at the 
Museum of Natural History in 
New York. Encouraged by the 
resurgence of the Lions, Bob and 
Dave joined Stan Schachter, Bill 
Grote and Gerry Evans for the 
Homecoming victory over 
Princeton. By the way. Bob and 
the class officers are starting to 
plan for our 45th reunion. Contact 
Bob at (212) 751-1106 if you would 


like to be on the committee. 

The next event on the calendar 
is a class cocktail party in the 
spring in the New York area. Time 
and date to be announced. If you 
have relocated or have some news 
to report, please send a post card 
to your class correspondent. We 
try to keep in touch; won't you 
please do the same?

Fred Becker continues to receive 
recognition for his work as vice 
president for research at the 
University of Texas M. D. 
Anderson Cancer Center in 
Houston, where he has been 
since 1976. 

He was recently featured as 
the cover-scientist in the publica¬ 
tion Cancer Research, in which he 
was commended for recruiting 
outstanding basic and clinical sci¬ 
entists and promoting collabora¬ 
tive research. 

Fred is a member of the 
National Cancer Advisory Board, 
a corresponding member of 
the Royal Academy of Arts and 
Sciences in Spain, and a past pres¬ 
ident of the American Association

the author of more than 190 
research papers, has written 25 
book chapters, and developed 
and edited two multi-volume 
works: Cancer, A Comprehensive 
Treatise and The Liver. 

I am sorry that I have nothing 
else to report because no one else 
submitted anything for this issue. 
With more and more of you retir¬ 
ing, you should be less pressured 
and have no excuse for not send¬ 
ing some little bit of news for our 
class notes.

Rolon Reed is again on the front 
page of the Orlando Lake Sentinel. 

He was appointed interim coimty 
attorney % a stormy three to two 
vote of the Lake County Conser¬ 
vation Coimcil. The minority 
claimed that the chairman of the 
council which nominated Rolon 
had "no heart" and was like the 
"Tm Man in The Wizard of Oz." 

The chairman responded that one 
member of the minority was the 
"Scarecrow, the one without the 
brain," and called the second mem¬ 
ber of the minority the "Cowardly 
Lion, the one without courage." 
Meanwhile, Rolon continues to 
fight for slow growth in their 
Florida county. We'U keep you 
posted. 

Larry Mattes is one of the 
pioneers in America's new way of 
working. After graduating from 
Columbia Business School and 
working for G.E., he decided to 
open his own §hop. For the past 16 
years, Larry has worked at home 
and built a successful marketing, 
communications, advertising and 
p.r. company in Cleveland. Larry 
married Tobi, and they have two 
children: Paul is a computer soft¬ 
ware engineer and Debbi is an 
instructor for large communica¬ 
tions systems. 

Last year, Ray Phillips retired 
from the Justice Department after 
working 30 years on criminal and 
other matters. Ray enjoys traveling 
with his wife Tonia and visiting 
his two daughters and two 
granddaughters. 

After being a widower for four 
years, Ben Roosa married Barbara. 
Quite a romantic story! Ben and 
Barbara met 35 years ago; they 
actually went together for about a 
year and then went their separate 
ways. Barbara married her first 
husband and had three children; 
Ben married and had four children. 
About a year ago, they became 
reacquainted and are now living 
happily in New York State. Ben 
reports that he has been a practic¬ 
ing smaU-town lawyer; the apple of 
his eye is his two-and-a-half-year- 
old grandson, and there's another 
on the way. Congratulations to 
Ben and Barbara! 

Nick Samios is director of the 
Brookhaven National Laboratory 
on Long Island with a $400 mil¬ 
lion annual budget. The lab is

Nobel Prize winners who worked 
at the lab including our classmate, 
Mel Schwartz. Nick married 
Mary in 1958; they have three 
children. Nick is also Adjunct 
Professor of Physics at Columbia. 

Mel, of course, is also back at 
Columbia as the 1.1. Rabi Professor 
of Physics. 


John Wuorinen is enjoying liv¬ 
ing in the last town on the east 
bank of the Penobscot River in 
Maine. If you would like to see 
the area, just look at the last 
scenes in The Hunt for Red 
October, which were filmed 
where John regularly sails. He 
was married to Caroline Stevens 
in 1956 and had four children. In 
1974, he married Susan Lund and 
had two additional children who 
are now in college. John reports 
that he worked at Bell Labs on 
R&D projects for 24 years; taught 
electrical engineering at the 
University of Maine for two

It was a glorious day. The sun 
was shining and Baker Field 
never looked better. Columbia 
students and alumni were in a 
festive mood, and the Columbia 
side of Wien Stadium was full... 
and vociferous. The fact that we 
beat Princeton at the 
Homecoming game after beating 
them in soccer earlier capped a 
perfect day. 

Among the members of the 
Class of Destiny I saw in atten¬ 
dance and feeling good were: 
Kamel Bahary, Leo Cirino, Dale 
Hopp, Peter Kenen, Les Levine, 
Harvey Rubin and Ted Spiegel. 

David Gerstein reports that 
last fall he attended a sympo¬ 
sium at Penn State on the 
American musical theater where 
a revival of the 1951 Columbia 
Varsity Show Babe in the Woods 
was staged. David, as one of the 
original cast members, was feted. 

Does anyone know the where¬ 
abouts of classmate Jonathan 
Mirsky? Someone reported see¬ 
ing his name on the cover of The 
New York Review of Books. 

Please let me hear from and 
about you.

What if tomorrow bring 
Sorrow or anything 
Other than joy? 

As we rapidly approach our 40th 
Reunion the words of "Sans 
Souci" bring back memories of 
our experiences in the era envied 
by people today—the Eifties—as 
so interestingly portrayed in our 
classmate Dan Wakefield's book 


New York in the Fifties. Do you 
recall: Saturday morning labs, 
Grayson Kirk, Proctor Walter 
Mohr, the Blue Key Society, 
AFROTC, the Players, Schrafft's, 
V&T, Perry Como, Ike, Ed 
Sullivan, Duke Snider, Prexy's, 
Arthur Godfrey, Mark Van 
Doren, Moses Hadas, Charles 
Krumm, David Truman, Lou 
Little, NROTC, C. Wright Mills, 
the beatniks, the Stork Club, 

Estes Kefauver, George Nobbe, 
Jim Shenton, Richard Hofstadter, 
Harry Carman, Salter's, the Gold 
Rail, Birdland, and more. 

We will not be reliving this 
part of our lives at our reunion 
but we're going to have a terrific 
and nourishing time renewing 
old acquaintances and sharing 
stories of years gone by and times 
not so long ago. Interwoven 
among the meetings held by your 
class steering committee, which 
has been planning events leading 
up to the 40th and the reunion 
itself, is news of stalwart mem¬ 
bers of the Class of '55. 

What if't be wintry chill, 

Rain, storm, or summer's thrill? 

We learned that Richard 
Ravitch was married this past 
summer; news travels slowly, like 
certain negotiations. Homecoming 
featured a good turnout from the 
class: The Connecticut duo. Bob 
Dillingham and Dan Culhane, 
was seen in deep discussion; Ron 
McPhee (one of three classmates 
at the baseball alumni reunion in 
the fall, with John Naley and Jack 
Freeman) made his annual pil¬ 
grimage to Baker Field; Charles 
Sergis came in from the West 
Coast with his family (it took a 
winning season to pique Charles's 
curiosity); also present were Jay 
Joseph (our formidable Class 
Treasurer) from Long Island; 
Aaron Preiser (enjoying his return 
to the East Coast), from New 
Jersey; Allen Hyman (he shows 
up everywhere); Donn Coffee 
(living a tri-coastal lifestyle in 
New York, California and 
London); Bob Hanson (looking 
with envy at the Boathouse and 
the Harlem River); Jack 
Armstrong and crew (acting and 
reacting as if he was still on the 
football field), residing in New 
Jersey and Lower Manhattan, and 
Ezra Levin, who trundled down 
from Riverdale to be with his 
buddies. 

Tomorrow's the future still; 

This is today. 

Walt Whittaker has informed 
us that he has retired after 35 
years with the Wilmington Trust 
Co. He will be spending his 
leisure time in Florida playing 
golf and a little three-man basket¬ 
ball. From Staten Island, Joe 
Porcelli writes that his daughter 
has entered her freshman year at 


the College. There was a heartfelt 
article in The New York Times 
about our own Elio Ippolito, 
who lives in Westchester. The 
write-up was entitled: "A Rare 
Find: A Doctor Who Makes 
House Calls." Great stuff! Donald 
Marcus, from his Brooklyn estate, 
has a new cause. He has been 
involved in the legalities related 
to jury selection procedures. Is 
justice blind? Stay tuned. Evans 
Gerakas, of Arlington, Va., a 
likely attendee at the reunion has 
just retired from the Office of the 
Historian at the Department of 
State. He also has time to do 
many of the things he has always 
wanted to do. 

Tomorrow's the future still; 

This is today. 

Along the East Coast, the ven¬ 
erable Harold Kushner, a Natick, 
Mass, resident, is in the midst of 
two major projects, one of which 
won't see the light of day for 
about a year or two, the other for 
about five years. We await anx¬ 
iously. Ivan Leigh, bad back and 
all, is looking forward to joining 
us in June, all the way from West 
Chester, Pa. Another author, 
albeit critic, Martin Gottfried, 
has just written a book well- 
reviewed in The New York Times: 
Nobody's Fool, a Danny Kaye biog¬ 
raphy. Eurther out west, we've 
heard from Hawaii's Norm 
Goldstein, who has promised to 
be on campus in June. Stanley 
Lubman will definitely be here 
for the reunion. He is one of the 
speakers who will try to expand 
our knowledge about China and 
China-U.S. relations.

1 was recently re-reading my let¬ 
ter to the class from last April, 
only because Rob Lauterborn 
sent a note to me on the back of 
it, and see that my financial 
advice that cash was no longer 
trash was prescient. What a 
tough year it's been in the mar¬ 
kets—certainly not advancing the 
growth of various retirement 
plans. 

1 was at our outstanding 
Homecoming, where 1 met Larry 
Gitten and Lou Hemmerdinger. 
We gloried in defeating Princeton 
on a lovely fall day. Now that our 
football team is embarking on 
better days, maybe more '56ers 
will attend Homecoming. Lou 
offered to join our 40th Reunion 
committee, of which Larry is 
already a member. 

My wife and 1 attended the 
Alexander Hamilton Dinner, 
where we met Lyn and Lee 
Seidler. (Both retired now, they 
winter on the west coast of 
Florida and summer in 
Connecticut.) The event, honor¬ 
ing the 75th anniversary of the 
Core Curriculum, touched off 
great positive feelings among the 
600 alumni, professors, and 
guests in the impressive Whale 
Room of the Museum of Natural 
History. 1 had most pleasant con¬ 
versation with many of the fac¬ 
ulty who have participated in 
Columbia's evening alumni col- 
loquia, including Ted de Bary '41, 
Carl Hovde '50 and Jim Shapiro 
'77, my current Shakespeare pro¬ 
fessor. 1 also had a lengthy con¬ 
versation with President Rupp 
during which 1 attempted to 
emphasize the importance of the 
evening alumni colloquia, which 
I have been attending faithfully 
since their inception eight years 
ago. My strong feeling is that the 
recent drastic reduction in course 
offerings is a terrible mistake, 
and that the University and 
College should do all in their 
power to enhance and increase 
positive interaction with alumni 
from day one. I hope 1 persuaded 
President Rupp. 


1 heard from Bob Lauterborn, 
now a most distinguished jour¬ 
nalism professor at U.N.C. in 
Chapel Hill. I was sorry to hear 
about his accident in April, 
which required a month's hospi¬ 
talization; 1 pray his rehabilita¬ 
tion gives him speedy recovery 
and permits him to resume his 
worldwide lecturing tours. Tm 
envious of his itinerary. 

1 also received a note from our 
"long lost" classmate Ed Gordon 
living in northern Westchester, 
not far from my summer house. 
He is the newly elected president 
of the New York Psychiatric 
Association, a responsibility 
requiring much interaction with 
Washington. Accompanied by his 
recently retired wife, Martha, he 
is defending the practice of medi¬ 
cine, which needs much defend¬ 
ing now. Ed has my best wishes. 
He is also planning to attend our 
40th Reunion. 

Speaking of reunion, 1 spoke to 
Nick Coch, who has again gra¬ 
ciously offered his new law firm's 
conference rooms in the Met Life 
(formerly Pan Am) building for our 
reunion committee meetings. All 
interested classmates are most wel¬ 
come and should contact me. 1 also 
speak frequently with my most 
excellent vice president A1 Brody, 
and he promises to try to make a 
strong effort to help in the reunion 
planning. My best wishes always 
go to A1 in his current battle. 

As always my best wishes go 
to you all for health, happiness 
and good retirement planning 
with a little wealth, and maybe 
you will send some of the latter to 
the College Fund to help achieve 
our fourth class scholarship.

Elliott Schwartz is humming 
again. After his Aria with 
Interruptions premiered in New 
York last year, we were glad he 
didn't shut up when we told him 
to. He just got louder and better. 
Elliott's in Maine after a visiting 
fellowship at Cambridge U. and 
a European tour to hear perfor¬ 
mances of his music. Buy the CD 
of his "Bellagio Variations" and 
buy his new book. Music Since 
1945. It'll make up for sleeping 
through Hum. 

A1 Raab is pounding the pave¬ 
ments again. After 28 years in 
Boston, where A1 worked in aero¬ 
space engineering, he and 
Frances moved to Bethesda, Md., 
and a new job as a senior staff 
officer at the National Academy 
of Sciences. A1 specializes in 
pavement performance research. 


Three daughters: Nancy (law and 
accounting), Amy (photogra¬ 
pher), and Jessica (acting). 

Ran into Saul Cohen recently, 
looking pleased; not only had the 
candidate for whom he raised 
funds, Rudolph Giuliani, won, 
but as the Mayor of New York, 
he married Saul off at Grade 
Mansion to lawyer Marian 
Shelton. 

When Ken Silvers read right 
here that Gene Wagner was 
moving close to his California 
neighborhood, he rushed out in 
the welcome wagon. Ken is a 
psychiatrist who teaches at 
UCLA, and his wife, Jessica, is an 
L.A. judge. Coming up fast are 
daughters Rachel, an attorney, 
and Beth, who is getting a Ph.D. 
in psychology. 

This is old Lion central. And the 
response to an in-depth class pro¬ 
file for our 40th has been encour¬ 
aging. Through questionnaires, 
interviews, etc., we'll explore 
where we are in our early 60's 
after coming through the mid-50's. 
Among the early sign-ons: 

John Taussig, vice-president 
and general manager of TRW 
Information Services in California, 
wonders if we were "forgotten? 
overlooked? dull and unevent¬ 
ful?" compared to the students of 
the 1960's. He asks: "Didn't the 
panty raids at Barnard have any 
social significance?" 

Sam Rosenberg writes from 
Bloomington, Ind., where he's a 
professor of French and Italian: 
"Excellent idea... hope you move 
ahead with it." 

Marty Fisher, with sons at 
Yale Law (Louis) and IBM's 
Credit Corp. (Mike), is now 
ready to retire from Big Blue and 
concentrate on Light Blue: "Sign 
me up. 1 love to be interviewed." 

And Alan Brilliant may be 
one of the first interviewed. Not 
only does he describe himself as 
"artist, drop-out, bum and 
peacenik," but he is "happy to 
say I remain bitter" about 
Columbia for the bookstore's 
refusing to stock his poetry mag¬ 
azine, PAN, in 1957, and for the 
school "being at the very center 
of the Military-Industrial- 
Academic complex that has 
destroyed the cultural and 
human potential of our country." 

We're silent no more! Let's 
hear from you, too.

Congratulations: 

To Ernie Brod on his promo¬ 
tion to executive managing direc¬ 
tor of Kroll Associates. Ernie is 





the head of the international 
investigative and consulting 
firm's U.S. office; 

to Frank Parisi on being 
awarded the Navy Commen¬ 
dation Medal. A career Navy offi¬ 
cer with the rank of captain, Frank 
received the medal for his signifi¬ 
cant accomplishments as a direc¬ 
tor for medical service at Naval 
Branch Medical Clinic, Naval 
Submarine Base, Kings Bay, Ga., 
where he is currently assigned; 

and to Stan Mandel on his 
election to the board of directors 
of Wachovia Bank of North 
Carolina, Chapel Hill. Stan is 
chief of staff at the Univ. of North 
Carolina School of Medicine. He 
is also v.p. of the N.C. chapter of 
the American College of Surgeons 
and past president of the Carolina 
Organ Procurement Agency. 

A recent New York magazine 
article entitled "In with the Om 
Crowd" included John Giorno 
and Larry Shainberg among the 
city's "glamorous power 
Buddhist set." 

"If you experience sudden 
chest pain, you have one hour to 
get to a hospital... Longer than 
that and you risk dying of a heart 
attack." This blunt advice comes 
from Walter Berkowitz, director 
of the new Chest Pain Center at 
Englewood (N.J.) Hospital. 

Walter and the new center (the 
first in northern New Jersey) 
were the subjects of a long article 
in the New Jersey section of a 
recent Sunday New York Times. 

But Walter, who is the chief of 
cardiology at Englewood 
Hospital and assistant clinical 
professor of medicine at P&S, did 
have some good news: Since it 
may help to produce "good" cho¬ 
lesterol, he recommends drinking 
four ounces of red wine a day! 

Fred Hess reports that he is 
now the director of the office of 
enforcement operations of the 
Department of Justice's Criminal 
Division and still lives in Vienna, 
Va. Fred's newest neighbor is Jim 
Bast, who has been named presi¬ 
dent and CEO of the Council of 
Better Business Bureaus, head¬ 
quartered in Arlington, Va. 

Arnold Cooperman reports 
that after 30 years of ob/gyn 
practice in Beverly Hills, he was 
forced to retire after hip surgery 
and will now be splitting his 
time between L.A. and Rancho 
Mirage, near Palm Springs 
(sounds like a tough break). 
Arnold and his wife Caroline 
recently celebrated their 40th 
wedding anniversary and 
became grandparents for the 
sixth time last year. 

Ted Lynn's latest book (writ¬ 
ten with Micah Broomfield) is 
entitled Real Estate Investment 
Trusts.

Robert Mogil is practicing urol¬

Philadelphia. Bob and his wife 
Susan Ravetz are looking for¬ 
ward to the wedding of their 
daughter Andrea (a recent 
Princeton grad), who is a profes¬ 
sional flutist in Seattle. Their son 
practices environmental law in 
Philadelphia. 

Brian Dennehy's stage, TV 
and film career is easy to follow 
(and not regularly documented 
in this column). A recent item, 
however, seems historically 
important enough to communi¬ 
cate. At a tribute to Brian's for¬ 
mer Boy Scout troop leader in 
Derby, Conn, (an event Brian 
attended), it was revealed that 
the actor got his start in show 
business with that very troop, 
singing "Be a Good Scout" in a 
1947 variety show organized by 
the Scouts. 

A news release is the appropri¬ 
ate vehicle for the information 
that Jerry Schmelzer has been 
elected to the College of Fellows 
of the Public Relations Society of 
America. Jerry owns an advertis¬ 
ing and p.r. firm in Cleveland 
and, with his brother, is develop¬ 
ing a luxury apartment and retail 
project opposite the Gateway 
ballpark and arena complex in 
downtown Cleveland. 

Haven't heard much from 
Robert Abrams since his retire¬ 
ment as New York State Attorney 
General, but a recent Times article 
describes a reunion of the Pelham 
Parkway neighborhood where 
Bob spent his pre-Columbia days. 
"All of us here grew up in a spe¬ 
cial place, a real working-class 
neighborhood," noted Bob, recall¬ 
ing that he worked behind the 
counter at his father's candy 
store. Red's Luncheonette. 




Bernard Cywinski '62 is a principal in the architecture firm of 
Bohlin Cywinski Jackson, which has received the 1994 Architecture 
Firm Award of the American Institute of Architects (AIA). The 
award is given to a practice that has produced distinguished work for 
at least 10 years; past recipients include I. M. Pei and Partners, 
Mitchell/Giurgola Architects, and James Stewart Polshek & Partners. 
Among Mr. Cywinski's notable works are the Harrisburg Inter¬ 
national Airport Passenger Terminal and the Carnivore Exhibit at 
the Philadelphia Zoological Garden. Pictured here is the main 
entrance to the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie-Mellon 
University (1987); this joint effort with Burt Hill Kosar Rittelmann 
Associates graces the cover of a new AIA monograph devoted to Mr. 

Cywinski's firm. 

Previously a project architect 
under Vincent G. Kling '38, Mr. 
Cywinski has been a principal at 
BCJ since 1979. A 1966 graduate 
of the Architecture School, where 
he was president of the student 
body, he has won numerous hon¬ 
ors, among them the Louis I. 

Kahn Citation and the National 
Library Buildings Award. Based 
in Philadelphia (his firm has 
offices as well in Wilkes-Barre, 
Pa., Pittsburgh, and Seattle), Mr. 
Cywinski is a design critic at 
several universities, including 
the University of Pennsylvania 
and Temple.

mented by the warmth generated 
by news of Columbia Lion victo¬ 
ries in the football season. We are 
also warmed by letters from 
classmates. 

Peter Feibelman reports from 
Albuquerque, N.M. that he pub¬ 
lished a book called A Ph.D. is 
Not Enough! A Guide to Survival in 
Science (Addison-Wesley, 1993). 
The book provides advice on get¬ 
ting from a doctorate to a career 
in research. Peter's daughter 
Camilla has entered Columbia as 
a freshman this year. 

Herb Soroca writes from 
Stamford, Conn, that he serves as 
senior vice president of Eiger 
Asset Management, handling 
futures accounts. Never one to 
resist a risky venture. Herb 
reports that he joined the 
Norwalk River Rowing Club, 
which has a very active masters 
program. Herb's words will pro¬ 
vide inspiration for other aging 
athletes of our class: 

"Much to my delight after the 
terror of the first day in a shell and 
almost thirty years past, it did 
come back just like riding a bicy¬ 
cle. We row fours and eights and 
on July 31,1994 in Delaware, 1 
competed in two races. We fin¬ 
ished third in the eight, but we 
were last in the four, where we 
were not in our proper age group. 

I met guys from Penn and 
Syracuse that I had raced against 
thirty years ago. On September 22, 
ten of us will arrive at the Masters 
National Regatta in Augusta, Ga. I 
am in a four with an engineer who 
rowed at Berkeley, a doctor who 
rowed at Georgetown, and 
another doctor who was a football 
player at Pitt. In addition to this 
boat, I am scheduled for an eight 
and also with a boat of older oars¬ 
men. (I can't wait for them to call 
me Sonny.)" 

Herb further reports that his 
wife Barbara manages the Stamford 
Symphony. His eldest son, Adam, 
graduated cum laude from Middle- 
bury CoUege and is at Steamboat 
Springs, Colo., where he will be 
packaging ski tours. His youngest 
son. Brad, is playing stopper for the 
Middlebury soccer team.

Our class's 30th Reunion will 
take place at Columbia on 
Eriday, June 2 through Sunday, 
June 4,1995. Our reunion com¬ 
mittee is planning an informa¬ 
tive and entertaining weekend. 
We hope to have our classmate 
David Denby speak to us about 
his experiences in returning to 
Columbia to take Lit Hum 
(known to us as Humanities). 
David is writing a book about 
his experiences and two chapters 
were published in The New 
Yorker over the last year. Those of 
us who have attended our 20th 
and 25th Reunions can attest that 
these reunions are profoundly 
satisfying and greatly enjoyable. 
Out-of-towners have a great 
excuse for a long weekend in 
New York during pleasant 
spring weather. Please make 
every effort to attend; you will 
not regret it. 

We have received scores of 
responses to the alumni informa¬ 
tion form recently sent out to our 
class, and space does not permit 
extensive quotation. A recurring 
theme in your responses is the 
successful transition through 
your 50th birthdays, children 
attending college (including 
Columbia), and career changes. 
All will be grist for the conversa¬ 
tion mill during our reunion, so 
come if you want news about 
your classmates. 

Specific information submitted 
by classmates will be included in 
future editions of these class 
notes.

Your class correspondent has just 
returned from lunch with Paul 
Kastin. We two adopted 


Atlantans get together two or 
three times a year to compare 
notes on recent and future busi¬ 
ness and pleasure travels to vari¬ 
ous parts of the world, in addi¬ 
tion to reminiscing about our 
shared alma maters in Cleveland 
Heights and in Morningside 
Heights. Paul and his family 
spent a week in each of Burma, 
Cambodia, and Thailand, and 
have recently returned from the 
Dordogne Valley in France (one 
of my family's favorite places, as 
well). My own business travels, 
which over the years have taken 
me with some frequency 
throughout Western Europe and 
to Russia, Turkey (where we 
lived for four years), Brazil (six 
years of residence), etc., have 
now begun to include South 
Africa, which I visited three 
times in 1994. Our family makes 
a point of visiting New York at 
least once a year—particularly 
during the holiday season, in 
addition to my wife's and daugh¬ 
ter's summer-long stays in Rio 
de Janeiro and a springtime jour¬ 
ney to Europe or to Asia. 

From Bar-Ilan University in 
Israel, Michael Harrison writes

Harvard's School of Education. 
Their son Nathan will complete 
his military service in July. 

Steven Handel has just 
returned from six months as a 
visiting professor at Macquarie 
University in Sydney, Australia, 
where he studied orchid pollina¬ 
tion and ecology. Steven com¬ 
ments that "Sydney is a wonder¬ 
ful, beautiful place to live— 
coming back to New Jersey 
seems like returning to a black- 
and-white movie!" 

From Glen Ridge, N.J., Joe 
Cody writes: "My wife Molly 
and I attended the marriage of 
Richard G. Beggs to Geri, over 
the Thanksgiving weekend. 

"George F. 'Fran' Furey is 
planning nuptials for this spring 
in San Francisco. 

"Tom Chorba (with wife 
Celeste and son Philip) and I (with 
daughter Kate) experienced both 
the ecstasy of the Lions' Home¬ 
coming win over Princeton (17-10) 
and the agony of the defeat at the 
hands of the Brown Bruins at the 
last game of the season. 

"All of us who played football 
noted with sadness the passing 
of 'Buff' Donelli, this summer."

It has been quite a while since 
last a column appeared for our 
class, undisputedly The Cleverest 
Class in the World. (Actually, 
Dwight Miner '26 did once dis¬ 
pute the idea, but we outnum¬ 
bered him and he backed off.) 
Unwilling to merely fabricate 
news, your correspondent has 
preferred to rely on your cards 
and letters, plausible rumor and 
mild innuendo to assemble 
columns fully worthy of the pub¬ 
lication in which they appear. Oh, 
he has on occasion allegedly 
threatened classmates with bodily 
harm if they failed to cooperate, 
but those charges never stuck. 

In her column in the last CCT, 
the correspondent for '89 pro¬ 
posed to discuss her own life in 
excessive detail unless her class¬ 
mates wrote in. This approach 
suggests wider applicability, and 
your correspondent has an even 
more sinister plan. And is pre¬ 
pared to use it. We are ready to 
discuss Richard Jupa's life in 
excessive detail—and who 
among us could bear the burden 
of causing that —unless news of 
even the most meagre interest or 
merit reaches our hands about 
some other classmates. Surely a 
few of us are engaged in some 
activity that is, if not socially use¬ 
ful, at least entertaining. 

For now, just two items must 
suffice. Kent Hall, who refuses to 
write directly, was recently found 
ineligible for the Federal Witness 
Protection Program. He had 
sought asylum under the pro¬ 
gram in the wake of unusually 
hostile reviews—and unusually 
large losses—for his extrava¬ 
gantly staged musical about 
Teutonic architects who shoot 
pool in Iowa, Angles in America. 

To his solitary credit, Elliot 
Bien has written in (pre-intimida¬ 
tion and everything!). He writes 
that, unable to attend reunions, he 
would like to pass along "a snap¬ 
shot of [his] life since Columbia." 
Armed with a J.D. from Columbia 
Law and an LL.M. from "that 
other law school in Cambridge" 
(our research has failed to clarify 
this cryptic reference), he taught 
law at DePaul in Chicago and 
engaged in some business litiga¬ 
tion before he "stumbled upon 
appellate practice." Formerly with 
a large San Francisco firm, he has 
been on his own since 1990. He 
was recently elected to the 136-

Greetings to the survivors and 
friends of the Class of '68. Besides 
the usual charcoal, Santa's mail- 
bag this year did contain two let¬ 
ters addressed to me, a clear sign 
of readers' interest in this column. 
Right? Right. Onward, and a spe¬ 
cial thanks to Bruce Levin and 
John Wells; without their input, I 
would have resorted to cynicism 
and fiction once again. 

Bruce Levin wrote (actually 
typed; does anyone really write?) 
to me (on official Columbia sta¬ 
tionery) and offered the follow¬ 
ing trivia (his words): Now a 
tenured professor of public 
health and deputy head of the 
division of biostatistics at 
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical 
Center, he is currently on sabbati¬ 
cal in Bear River, Nova Scotia, 
"fulfilling a 26-year-dream to do 
mathematics in the woods." For 
the record, he earned his Ph.D. 
from Harvard in 1974, then 
returned to alma mater to teach 
in the (then) department of math¬ 
ematical statistics, and later 
moved uptown to CPMC, where 
he's been a fixture since 1979. He 
and his wife Betty, associate pro¬ 
fessor of health & nutrition sci¬ 
ences at Brooklyn College of 
CUNY, have two children: Joel, 
20, a collegian at Wesleyan, and 
Laura, 15, a student at Riverdale 
High School. 

John Wells, the other source 
for this column, proudly reported 
(also typed, on computer paper) 
that he and a few of his Sigma 
Chi cronies—Emilio Bruna, El 
Paso, Texas; Mario Bruni, White 
Plains, N.Y.; and Ed Siegel, 
Shaker Heights, Ohio (Cleveland 
attorney and bon vivant, who 
may remember me someday)— 
ventured to the Big Apple for the 
'94 Columbia Homecoming. The 
trek was John's first visit since 
"the dark days" of 1968. Based 
on what he saw ("the campus 
and student body have improved 
greatly; I was impressed!"), he 
and his Chi cohorts already plan 
to return to campus for the 30th 
Reunion. Friends and other 
brothers can sign up for the next 
bus tour by contacting John at his 
business. Big Sandy Hardware 
Co., Inc., P.O. Box 330, Hager 
Hill, Ky. 41222-0330, or at his 
home in nearby Paintsville. 

From the grapevine... Roger 
Wyatt, associate professor of 


library information management 
at Emporia State University in 
Kansas, recently received a cre¬ 
ative achievement award from 
the International Visual Literacy 
Association in recognition of "on¬ 
going creative work that substan¬ 
tially furthers the cause of visual 
literacy and significantly 
advances the creative field." 
Congratulations. 

Best wishes to everyone, espe¬ 
cially my friends (you know who 
you are), who makes this column 
possible.

I could almost fill a column with 
only press clippings on Paul 
Auster. Over the last several 
months, Paul's latest novel, Mr. 
Vertigo, has been favorably 
reviewed and prominently adver¬ 
tised in the New York Times Book 
Review; an earlier novel. City of 
Glass, has been released as a comic 
book or "graphic novel" by Neon 
Lit (an imprint of Avon Books), as 
reported in Newsweek; and a New 
York Times Op-Ed piece was being 
filmed under the title Smoke, as 
recounted in a New Yorker "Talk of 
the Town" profile on Paul. 

The Wall Street Journal 
reported on Hoffer Kaback's 
election as a member of the 
board of Lewis Galoob Toys, Inc. 
Hoffer, the president of Glouster 
Capital Corp., also serves as a 
director of two other companies.

Rick Winston wrote to advise 
us of his surprise in seeing in the 
reunion directory that he is living in 
Philadelphia, since he has actually 
been in Adamant, Vt. for 24 years 
(correct address: Box 32, Adamant, 
Vt. 05640, phone 802-454-7103). He 
continues: "Adamant is a tiny vil¬ 
lage right outside the state capital, 
Montpelier, where I have been the 
co-owner and co-manager of a one- 
screen 'art' or 'specialty' house, the 
Savoy Theater, since 1981. It must 
have something to do with all those 
hours at the New Yorker and 
Thalia." Rick adds that he and his 
wife (Andrea Serota) also opened 
an "alternative video store" in the 
basement of the theater five years 
ago, which Andrea is managing. 
Their two children are both at 
Carleton College. Rick also reports 
that he is playing accordion and 
piano in the Nisht Geferlach 
Klezmer Band, "northern New 
England's only Yiddish music 
ensemble." Unfortunately, he 
omits mention of the Columbia- 
related activity that inspired his

Klezmer performances. 

I stare at the other post¬ 
reunion message I received with 
a sense of disbelief and profound 
sadness—a postcard from Tom 
Dorris, who was tragically killed 
in a car accident shortly after the 
reunion. I distinctly recall the 
time I first met Tom; it was early 
in our freshman year and Tom— 
a new reporter for the College's 
hometown news service—was 
interviewing Andy Bronin, our 
newly elected freshman class 
president. (I came in second to 
Andy and was the class vice- 
president, meeting with him dur¬ 
ing the interview.) 1 was at once 
struck by Tom's easy tempera¬ 
ment, quiet wit, openness and 
interest in others. We had a fresh¬ 
man class together and formed a 
friendship that endured for 25 
years, even as Tom's career in 
journalism took him from 
Morningside Heights, to 
Washington, to Geneva for 11 
years (as editor of Ecumenical 
Press Service), and finally in mid- 
1992 to Sweden (as communica¬ 
tion director of the Life & Peace 
Institute, an international and 
ecumenical center for research 
and reflection). Tom somehow 
managed to stay in touch. For 
several years, we exchanged 
lengthy letters on our reflections 
on the event of the day. Later on, 
there were occasional phone 
calls, but more importantly the 
surprise—and always wel¬ 
comed—visits when Tom was 
passing through New York. 

Other classmates and College 
alumni will have similar recollec¬ 
tions of links with Tom that held 
steady over time and distance, 
because with Tom there was 
truly friendliness in the friend¬ 
ships he made. It is therefore not 
at all surprising that in his final 
postcard to me, Tom wrote: 

"Michael: Alas, in the end, I 
was not able to be in New York 
for the 25th reunion. I look for¬ 
ward to the directory and what¬ 
ever written reports will appear 
to help make up what I have 
missed. 

"A suggestion to make your 
fine alumni notes column even 
better and more useful: Unless 
you have reason to think a partic¬ 
ular alumnus would not wish it, 
why not include his address and 
phone/fax number (even e-mail, 
if you have it) whenever you 
mention one of our classmates. 
Now and again, I would contact 
someone you have mentioned in 
the column, but am unable read¬ 
ily to do so, lacking the relevant 
data... Happy Summer. Greetings 
to Sharon. Valkomna till Sverige!" 

Tom's own entry in the directory 
includes among his activities: 
"Intentional about maintaining 
contact with a rather wide group 


of friends, professional acquain¬ 
tances, former colleagues (from 
high school, Columbia, past jobs, 
summer programs, etc.)." Now 
this "rather wide group" shares a 
deep sense of loss in the only cir¬ 
cumstance that could have kept 
Tom from staying in touch.

The view from the Baker Field 
bleachers this past fall was 
delightful. The usual crew of this 
writer, Terry Sweeney, Dennis 
Graham and Bemie Josefsberg 
made regular appearances. 
Surprise appearances by Mike 
Bradley, an industrial hearing 
testing consultant in Rowe, 

Mass., and Dick Alexander, an 
orthodontist currently practicing 
in Brookfield, Wis., were wel¬ 
come additions. Fred Rappaport, 
an M.D. who runs Pacific Health 
Care Limited in Hong Kong, also 
made a guest appearance. 

Our reunion committee met 
before the Homecoming victory 
against Princeton at Baker Field. 
Art Kokot, Jim Periconi, Steve 
Schwartz, Phil Olivetti and 
Peter Stevens continue to plan 
the festivities. If the CCT mail¬ 
man is on time, there should still 
be time to sign on for this event 
scheduled for the weekend of 
June 2M. It promises to be mem¬ 
orable. Please also consider giv¬ 
ing generously to the 25th 
Reunion Class Fund. It's not too 
late. Other class members who 
have worked on the reunion 
include Dan Feldman, Dennis 
Graham, Frank Motley, Jay 
Worenklein, Fred White and Leo 
Kailas. 

Other news of note: Rich 
Yospin's son Matthew is a mem¬ 
ber of the Class of 1998. Jonathan 
Beard, a science writer and a reg¬ 
ular contributor to the technol¬ 
ogy section of New Scientist mag¬ 
azine, recently reviewed in that 
publication Jonathan Weisgall's 
new book. Operation Crossroads: 
The Atomic Tests at Bikini Atoll. 
The book analyzes the first post¬ 
war atomic tests on this island 
and their effect on the thousands 
of American sailors who were 
exposed to varying levels of radi¬ 
ation in these blasts. 

A last reminder: Our 25th 
Reunion is a once-in-a-lifetime 
event. The more of us who 
attend, the more meaningful it 
will be for us individually, collec¬ 
tively, and as Columbia College 
graduates. See you there!

Phil Bartolf writes from Califor¬ 


nia: "I have remarried, 5/1/93, to 
Patsy Noah. With my daughter 
Julia, and her boys Adam and 
Michael, we're a mini Brady 
Bunch. I've also left the corporate 
insurance world and gone onto 
the brokerage side. So far so 
good. My daughter, I proudly 
relate, has pulled straight A's in 
fifth and sixth; is on an All-Star 
soccer team as left half; made her 
school's All-Star volleyball team; 
and is number one on her tennis 
team. A scholar jock. We'll hope 
it continues. She will attend the 
Brentwood School in September 
1994. And Columbia in 2000? 
What will tuition be then?" 

Dick Fuhrman writes that he 
"recently was elected to the 
board of trustees of the Unitarian 
Universalist Service Committee, 
an international human rights 
agency. I am senior vice presi¬ 
dent of Frank Crystal & Co., a 
Manhattan insurance broker 
(212-504-5932). I live with my 
wife and daughter in Great Neck, 
N.Y, where I am treasurer of the 
public library." 

John Yohalem sent an occult 
journal that he edits, but he made 
it disappear. If he makes it reap¬ 
pear or sends another. I'll quote 
from it next issue.

Jeffrey L. Jackson is now com¬ 
pleting three years as senior 
advisor on privatization, restruc¬ 
turing and other issues to the 
ministry of finance for the 
Kingdom of Swaziland. Next 
stop: deputy managing director 
of the Swaki Investment Corp. 
"It's very exciting living in south¬ 
ern Africa," he writes, "and see¬ 
ing the change first-hand. There 
are lots of University alumni in 
the region." 

Luis J. Lauredo has accepted 
Gov. Lawton Chiles' invitation to 
coordinate the Summit of the 
Americas, planned for Miami and 
scheduled to take place just as CCT 
goes to press. Over 30 heads of 
state, called together by President 
Clinton, will convene to discuss the 
economic future of the Americas. 

To tackle this task, Luis has 
stepped down from the Horida 
Public Service Commission. 

Jazz pianist Armen Donelian 
has received his fifth fellowship 
from the National Endowment 
for the Arts. This one supports 
a series of jazz master classes at 
the New School in New York. 
Armen's solo piano album, A 
Reverie, is being re-released by 
Sunnyside Records. He heads 
the jazz ear-training curriculum 
at the New School and New 
Jersey's William Paterson 
College. 





Another classmate in the acad¬ 
emic music world is Greg 
Vitercik, associate professor of 
music at Middlebury College in 
Vermont. Greg has been develop¬ 
ing computerized instructional 
programs to enhance music 
teaching. A recent product is "The 
Heart of the Fugue," a hypercard 
program on the Bach fugue that 
includes historical information, 
structural diagrams, musical 
scores, fugal components, and 
techniques of fugal development. 
His assessment of the new tech¬ 
nology: "It can't replace the lec¬ 
ture, but it can make some of that 
material available for reconsider¬ 
ation or further study." 

Richard Waldhom is acting 
chief, division of pulmonary and 
critical care medicine, Georgetown 
University School of Medicine. He 
lives in Chevy Chase, Md. with 
wife Jamie and children Daniel, 
now six, and Dana, a newborn. 

Ken Abramowitz was promi¬ 
nently quoted in a front-page 
New York Times report on 
December 23 which discussed 
the transformation of American 
medicine; in particular: the rapid 
growth of for-profit HMO's. "It's 
the corporatization of health 
care," Ken commented, adding, 
"And what's wrong with that?" 

Ken is a health care market 
analyst and investment adviser 
for Sanford C. Bernstein & 
Company in New York and is 
also one of the more active mem¬ 
bers of our class in College 
alumni matters. He lives in 
Scarsdale, N.Y. 

Finally, a coda to one of the 
saddest events our class has 
faced. Thirteen years ago, John 
Chase Wood, Jr., then a 31-year- 
old surgery resident at Columbia- 
Presbyterian Medical Center, was 
accosted on a street outside the 
hospital, shot, and killed. His 
wife, Diana, was four months 
pregnant with their first child. 
Amidst the cries of sorrow for a 
life of promise brutally cut short, 
one man, Manhattan detective 
Jerry Giorgio, determined to find 
the killers. A few months ago, 
years spent doggedly checking 
leads paid off. Detective Giorgio 
arrested the man he believes shot 
John Wood; two other suspects 
have been identified. The alleged 
murderer, who has served 10 
years in prison for another 
killing, has been indicted and will 
be tried in the coming months. 
Diana, then a nurse, but now a 
P&S graduate practicing anesthe¬ 
siology in the Boston area, 
expressed the hope that the trial 
will bring closure to this terrible 
trauma for her, their son, and 
John's family.

Greetings from the land of the 
Yale Bowl, where the Lions 
romped 30-9 this year (it wasn't 
that close, either). Our small 
group cheered vociferously. 

Also at the game were Rick 
Blank and his 10-year-old son, 
along with his dad, who is CC 
'48. Rick has his own insurance 
business in White Plains, N.Y., 
which is an eight-minute drive 
from his house. He has appeared 
on CNN several times discussing 
ways to control personal insur¬ 
ance costs. Rick still plays full- 
court hoops once a week (certain 
class notes fodder), despite hav¬ 
ing torn his anterior cruciate liga¬ 
ment late last year. He reports 
that Steve Pellino recently had a 
son, Frank, and that "Splee" was 
written up in the Times (and was 
on TV) for his successful work on 
behalf of one of his clients. 

Henry Rosenberg, in a note 
from Northampton, Mass., shares 
a line from the Allen Ginsberg 
'48 poem, "Memory Gardens": 
Can I go back in time & lay my head 
on a teenage belly upstairs on 110th 
Street? 

Unfortunately, no. Kevin Foley 
is peeved (and rightly so) that he 
was at the 20th Reunion and 1 
wasn't; says it was a good time. 
We'll reune at the 25th, KF. On the 
young'un front. Bill Miller is liv¬ 
ing in New Rochelle and has two 
kids, Robert (nine) and Zachary 
(almost three). Allan Solomon is 
the "proud but exhausted" father 
of twin boys, Adam and Jarad, 
who were 2 in May. 

In the Sigma news. Bob 
Dillinger practices law (mostly 
criminal and personal injury) in 
the Tampa Bay area. He and his 
family recently came up north, 
toured the CU campus, and were 
impressed with some of the 
physical improvements. His 
daughter is in her third year at 
the Univ. of Florida. Bob stays in 
touch with Mike Rackoff, who is 
out in California, mentions that 
Robert Chong is a dentist in the 
area, and says their alumni club 
is fairly active. Bob would like to 
hear from other '73ers, so get the 
lead pencils out! 

Ken Kutscher, having "bucked 
the Republican tide," was elected 
mayor of Flemington, N.J. Ken is 
also associate clinical professor in 
internal medicine and cardiology 
at Robert Wood Johnson University 
and an attending physician in car¬ 
diology at the Hunterdon Medical 
Center. And the ever-present Phil 
Schaap won two Grammys for The 
Complete Billie Holiday on Verve, 
1945-1959 at the 1994 awards. 

Not sure what happened, but I 



Patrick W. Dowd '74 has been 
named vice president of Aetna 
Health Plans in Charlotte, N.C., 
where he oversees managed care, 
group health, and life businesses 
for both North and South 
Carolina. Previously he was 
president of Aetna Health Plans 
of Colorado, with similar respon¬ 
sibilities for Colorado, Utah, and 
Wyoming. Before joining Aetna, 
Mr. Dowd was executive director 
of the Partners Health Plans 
organization, a vice president of 
Peak Health Plans, and an audi¬ 
tor and consultant for Touche 
Ross & Co. (now Deloitte & 
Touche). 

Mr. Dowd, a certified manage¬ 
ment accountant and CPA, is a 
1984 graduate of the University 
of Colorado School of Business 
and a former board member of 
several Colorado health and edu¬ 
cational organizations. A resi¬

It seems that it takes a special 
event to get you guys to come 
out of the woodwork. I mean, 
here I am begging for news and 
my pleas fall on mostly deaf ears 
(don't any of you have a book or 
movie to plug?) and then it's the 
20th Reunion and suddenly I'm 
more popular than someone 
offering free beer. (Now that 
we're all—gasp—40, do we still 
drink beer?) Or was it the even 
rarer occurrence of a winning 
Lion football season? Well, I 


don't want to seem an ingrate, so 
thanks a lot for finally respond¬ 
ing with news. 

And there's a lot of it. As I have 
observed in this space before, 
Columbia alums seem to fall into 
three groups: doctors, lawyers 
and "You're doing what? Oh!" 
Let's go in alphabetical order. 

Doctors: Michael Craig has 
certainly kept busy. He has five 
kids, ranging in age from 6 to 15; 
his oldest, also named Michael, is 
a sophomore in high school, 
which makes some of us feel very 
old. Michael's wife, Jayne, is a 
nurse, and Michael is an orthope¬ 
dic surgeon in Danbury, Conn. 
(Michael lists Ta-Kome as one of 
the positive aspects of his 
Columbia experience, so it's clear 
he's not a gastroenterologist.) He 
also is active in several local med¬ 
ical organizations, as well as the 
Ridgefield Basketball Association 
and the town Little League. He's 
also a regular at C.U. home bas¬ 
ketball games, so I hope he's fun- 
neling talent to alma mater. 

Alan Fixelle is happily living 
and practicing medicine in 
Atlanta, Ga., where he avoids 
winters like last year's. (Go 
ahead, Alan, rub it in.) He and 
Marianne, his wife (an RN, like 
Jayne Craig), have three children, 
including Allison, who joined the 
family on September 11. Alan is 
on the board of his synagogue 
and in "multiple gastroenterology 
organizations." Meanwhile, back 
in the Northeast, William Hong is 
shivering with the rest of us, prac¬ 
ticing cardiology in his home¬ 
town, Manahawkin, N.J. William 
and his wife Lori (who is also in a 
medical business—X-Ray 
Associates) have two children, 
Katie, 13, and Thomas, 11. He's 
president of the medical staff at 
Southern Ocean County Hospital, 
so if you have a swimming acci¬ 
dent this summer vacation.... 

Albert Knapp sends the fol¬ 
lowing message: "Upon comple¬ 
tion of my medical (gastroen¬ 
terology) training at Brigham and 
Women's Hospital and Harvard 
Medical School, I took the plunge 
and returned to New York City, 
where I married the love of my 
life, Alice (Vassar '77), and estab¬ 
lished a thriving consultative 
practice. My other interest has 
been national politics, and I last 
served on the 1992 Tsongas cam¬ 
paign. I have yet to decide on a 
candidate for 1996." 

Philip Roth was recently pro¬ 
moted to associate professor of 
pediatrics at Albert Einstein 
College of Medicine and appointed 
director of Einstein's fellowship 
training program in neonatology. 
He and his wife Ruth Tepler B'76 
live in New Rochelle, N.Y. with 
their three children, ranging in 





age from 3 to 10. 

Lawyers: Gary Jenkins is liv¬ 
ing in one of my favorite towns, 
Cambridge, Mass., where he 
recently joined the State Street 
Bank as senior attorney in charge 
of 401 (k) pension business. He 
also recently published a paper 
in the Journal of Taxation of 
Employee Benefits, "ERISA Section 
404(c): Guidance for Employers." 

Closer to home—in Jackson 
Heights—David Isby juggles 
careers as an attorney for Sparta, 
Inc., providing analysis for the 
Department of Defense relating 
to ABM Treaty issues and negoti¬ 
ations with the Russians, and as 
a writer. David recently finished 
the manuscript of his 10th book, 
GI Victory, a collection of World 
War II color photography. 

If the end of the Cold War cuts 
into David's workload, imagine 
how Michael Gordon must feel. 
Michael is practicing law in West 
Orange, N.J., and was a member 
of Governor Florio's Emergency 
Solid Waste Task Eorce; he 
recently co-authored a chapter in 
a book. Toxic Circles: Environ¬ 
mental Hazards from the Workplace 
into the Community, with Dr. Ellen 
K. Silbergeld, a MacArthur 
Eellow. Michael and his wife 
Alice (who is a clinical psycholo¬ 
gist) have two children, Jeremy, 

5, and Carmel, 3. 

If it is the ambition of every 
lawyer to become a judge, and the 
ambition of every film person to 
work with Steven Spielberg, then 
Bruce Einhom has hit the daily 
double. Bruce, who lives in L.A. 
with his wife Terri (another RN) 
and their two sons, is an immigra¬ 
tion judge, chair of the civil rights 
committee of the Anti-Defamation 
League, adjunct professor at 
Pepperdine Law School (surf's up, 
Bruce), and an adviser and consul¬ 
tant to Amblin Entertainment. But 
Bruce, the big question is, what 
will they name the new studio? 

On a more serious note, Bruce 
spent 11 years, from 1979 to 1990, 
as a prosecuting attorney and then 
as deputy director of the Justice 
Department's Office of Special 
Investigations, the unit which 
sought the identification, denatu¬ 
ralization and deportation of Nazi 
war criminals residing in the U.S. 

Michael Dulberg moved to 
Scottsdale, Ariz. 10 years ago and 
since then, his law practice has 
focused on construction law and 
commercial litigation. In one of 
his recent efforts, Michael and his 
associates obtained a $3 million 
jury verdict in a business tort 
case involving political corrup¬ 
tion and public works construc¬ 
tion. He has also lectured to the 
State Bar of Arizona and various 
construction industry groups on 
legal issues concerning construe-

tion law. Michael and his wife, 
Marcy Morgen, have two sons, 
Adam and David, who are 9 and 
5, respectively. 

Edward Dolan is a partner 
with a D.C. law firm, Hogan and 
Hartson, a former president of 
the Bankruptcy Bar Association 
of Maryland, and the president 
of his local school board, which 
is appropriate since he and his 
wife, Margaret (also an attorney), 
have two school-age children, 
Caroline and William. 

What the rest of us are doing: 
Of course, no list of Columbia 
alumni activities would be com¬ 
plete without those fortunate 
ones who chose to go into the 
business world. (It means there's 
somebody out there I can borrow 
money from, right?) Douglas 
Emde is in real estate in Chicago, 
and writes, "We recently com¬ 
pleted renovation/restoration of 
a 100+ year old rowhouse in the 
historic district of Chicago as a 
new residence. Now we're shop¬ 
ping for art to fill it." Doug has 
been married for five years to 
Joyce Simon and has two adult 
stepchildren. 

Andrew Farber was in manage¬ 
ment consulting for many years 
but recently accepted an offer 
from Consumers Union (the pub¬ 
lishers of Consumer Reports) to join 
their staff as manager of financial 
controls, in which capacity he is 
responsible for their budget and 
purchasing systems. Andy's wife 
Joan is a rabbi; they have two 
kids, Miriam and Adam. 

Four years ago, Charles 
Lindsay decided he had had 
enough of Wall Street and retired 
to raise his family and "have some 
fun." He started his own company 
to invest in new technologies and 
says he's "keeping my head above 
water. Four kids and plenty to do. 
Life is good." His wife. Fern 
Morgan, is a town representative 
in Greenwich, Conn., having also 
retired from the rat race. 

If Doug Emde is still having 
trouble filling his house with art, 
he might consult Peter Holliday. 
Peter is an assistant professor of 
art history at Cal State-San 
Bernadino, and recently won the 
Rome Prize in art history from 
the American Academy in Rome. 

Richard Einhom has continued 
to pursue a music career. Most 
recently, he tells us, he "composed 
an opera for Carl Dreyer's The 
Passion of Joan of Arc and music 
for the New York City Ballet." 

I've saved my favorite item for 
last. Robert Lucy is living in 
Fallbrook, Calif., where he is 
president of the Del Ray Avocado 
Co., and a commissioner on the 
California Avocado Commission. 
Allow me to assure you, Rob, 
that I am a most enthusiastic con¬ 


sumer of your product. Rob and 
his wife Susan (yet another RN; 
have a lot of us been spending 
time in hospital, gentlemen?) 
have three children, Patrick, 
Donny and Hannah. 

Well, I've had a lot of fun with 
this column in the last couple of 
years, and it's been great to find 
out where some of you have 
been. If my approach to alumni 
notes is a bit tongue in cheek, 
well, some of you know me, and 
that's the way I am. I offer this 
observation as a not-too-subtle 
way of reminding you that the 
20th Reunion approaches rapidly, 
so if you are offended by any¬ 
thing in this column, you'll have 
a chance this summer to tell me 
to my face. Is there a doctor in 
the house? (I'd ask for a nurse, 
but I'm happily married.) 

See you this summer.

Tim Tracey, formerly of New 
York, Boston, Minneapolis, 
Albuquerque, Las Vegas, Seattle, 
and Tampa, has moved again— 
this time to Cedar Rapids, la., 
where he is a financial officer for 
a large multinational manufac¬ 
turing firm. His wife, Mary, and 
son, Derek, are doing fine. Derek 
is the best geography student in 
his class. 

Clyde Moneyhun, Tucson, 

Ariz., is back in touch as he grays 
into his forties and approaches our 
20th Reunion (I'm also approach¬ 
ing our 20th Reunion, but I refuse 
to participate in the former!—DM). 
Multiple congratulations are due 
as Clyde finishes his doctorate in 
rhetoric at the University of 
Arizona and becomes Dr. 
Moneyhun. He recently married 
Nancy Buffington, soon to finish 
her Ph.D. in American literature, 
and by the time this is published, 
they will have had their first 
child, Jesse Clyde, Class of 2016. 
Since leaving Columbia, Clyde 
has received an MFA in literature, 
taught English in Japan, translated 
a Japanese novel to English, and is 
working on another translation. 
And, as icing on the cake, he will 
be teaching at "the school of my 
dreams. New Mexico Highlands 
University," east of Santa Fe, where 
he has been offered a tenure-track 
position. Again, congratulations on 
a great beginning to a stellar career. 

Tony Anemone, Williamsburg, 
Va., has just finished his second 
year teaching Russian language 
and literature at the College of 
William and Mary. He would like 
to hear from "long lost friends 
and classmates." 

Robert K. Erlanger, now in 



Abbe Lowell '74, founder and 
managing partner of the Wash¬ 
ington, D.C. law firm of Brand 
& Lowell, recently completed 
an appointment in Geneva as 
Counsellor to the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human 
Rights. In his three months in the 
post, Mr. Lowell worked on a 
wide assortment of human rights 
issues involving U.N. programs 
in Haiti, Cuba, the former 
Yugoslavia, and especially 
Rwanda: He visited the African 
nation numerous times, helping 
establish the U.N. human rights 
field operation there and investi¬ 
gating charges of genocide by the 
former government. 

A graduate of the Law School 
and a former editor of the Law 
Review, Mr. Lowell previously 
served in the Carter administra¬ 
tion as Special Assistant to the 
U.S. Attorney General and as a 
Special Assistant U.S. Attorney 
in the District of Columbia. At 
Brand & Lowell, he has special¬ 
ized in the investigation and 
trial practice of white-collar 
crime, notably savings-and-loan 
and corruption cases. He is an 
on-air legal analyst for CNN 
and NBC and teaches the litiga¬ 
tion of complex criminal cases at 
Georgetown University Law 
Center.

Weehawken, N.J., is building his 
own general law and litigation 
practice—including a lot of inter¬ 
national child abduction mat¬ 
ters—but that is only recently. He 
was head of marketing, planning, 
and research for Pan American 
World Airways, leaving two years 
before its demise, and has been 
involved in several business start¬ 
ups, including an aborted attempt 
to restart Liberia's national air car¬ 
rier during a lull in the civil war, 
and managed to practice law "on 
the side" until going full-time in 
1992. If things are slow at work, 
he heads home to be the proud 
papa of Erica Danielle, 8 years 


old, Alexander Brett, 5, Sidonie 
Rebecca, 2, and stepson twins 
Mathew and Jeremy, 14. (He goes 
to work to get some rest.) 

Rob also sent news of wayward 
classmates: Brad Goldman is a 
vice president with Oppenheimer 
& Co. in New York, where he spe¬ 
cializes in labor union pension 
fund investments. He and wife 
Lisa have a daughter, Sara Molly. 
Larry Edelson, after spending 
many years in the commodity 
trading business, has started a 
cabinet-making firm "somewhere 
near" Jupiter, Fla. 

Start thinking of our upcoming 
20th Reunion. Wishing everyone 
and their families a happy and 
healthy new year until next time; 
take 'er easy.

In his short life. Mason Wiley 
created and accomplished much. 
The book jacket of Inside Oscar 
(which he co-wrote with class¬ 
mate Damien Bona) wryly noted 
that Mason had not missed an 
Oscar telecast in two decades. He 
was a history major as well as a 
film reviewer, and it showed. 
Vincent Canby called the first 
edition of Inside Oscar "a giddy 
social history of our place and 
time." With accounts of back- 
stage wrangling, a knack for 
Oscar trivia, and a comprehen¬ 
sive overview of film history, our 
classmate was a brilliant social 
historian. 

His other acclaimed chef 
d'oeuvre was The Official Preppy 
Handbook, which he co-authored 
several years after graduation. 
New York magazine published an 
account of Mason's campaign to 
obtain full credit for his role in 
the work, which was initially 
downplayed. 

It should not be forgotten that 
Mason was associated with the 
Fox network as a writer for the 
five unaired Howard Stern televi¬ 
sion pilot shows. Mason's genius 
was not fully documented by the 
obituaries and memorials. 

Jeffrey Sovern, a professor of 
law at St. John's University, who 
was recently mugged in Flushing, 
wrote a letter to The Neio York 
Times in which he criticized the 
procedures of the police, who will 
not accept a telephoned crime 
report. They require instead that 
the victim report the crime in per¬ 
son at the precinct station house, 
thereby losing the opportunity to 
pursue the criminal right away. 

Our best wishes to those hav¬ 
ing the good fortune to turn 40 
this year. Please help us chronicle 
whatever is on your mind.

Richard Froehlich 
357 West 29th Street, 
Apt. 2B 

New York, N.Y. 10001 

The reunion committee has 
begun work on our tenth-year 
reunion, scheduled for June 2^. 
We all hope that as many class¬ 
mates as possible will make their 
plans to be in New York. As a 
precursor, this column is dedi¬ 
cated to bringing classmates up- 
to-date on what people who have 
filled in their questionnaires have 
been doing with their lives. 

Cary Berger lives in Los 
Angeles and describes himself as 
a lawyer/musician. The lawyer 
side was educated at Stanford, 
where he graduated in 1989. 

Now he works at the L.A. firm of 
Irel & Manella. The musician side 
has composed the soundtrack for 
the film Suture, directed by class¬ 
mate Scott McGehee and David 
Siegal and distributed by 
Goldwyn Pictures. Cary writes 
that he is now working on a 
soundtrack for a film by Cecily 
Rhett '86. 

Mark Rothman also lives in 
Los Angeles and is working in 
the film/video industry as a 
director and producer. He mar¬ 
ried Victoria Jill Bernstein 
Rothman in 1989 and they have a 
son named Saul. Mark received 
an MFA from USC and has 
directed documentary short sub¬ 
jects on an Olympic hopeful and

Los Angeles. 

Daniel Salzer is a licensed 
clinical psychologist and lives in 
Los Angeles. After receiving his 
M.A. in human development 
from Columbia, he went to USC 
and received an M.A. and Ph.D. 
in clinical psychology. 

Douglas Falby works as a 
photographer in London and is 
married to Nicola Robin 
Symington. He writes that he 
had an interesting path to pho¬ 
tography through jobs as an 
advertising art director and then 
as a bike messenger. Through the 
thick, he had several crises but 
states affirmatively that he now 
is happy! 

Joseph Chu works for the City 
of New York as the deputy direc¬ 
tor of planning for the Parks 
Department. 

Edward Truscelli is an archi¬ 
tect. He has a master's in archi¬ 
tecture from the University of 
Virginia. He and Elizabeth Green 
are engaged, and they plan to 
marry this year. Ed was the pro¬ 
ject architect in the construction 
of the Mercer County Waterfront 
Baseball Park for the Double-A 
baseball team in Trenton. He is 
now developing a consulting 
practice in commercial/residen¬ 
tial building analysis. 


It should not come as a big 
surprise that the Class of '85 has 
produced a bunch of lawyers. 
David Zapolsky now lives in 
Seattle and works for the firm 
Bogle & Gates. He is a graduate 
of Berkeley's Boalt School of Law, 
where he met his wife, Lindsay 
Brown. They have a one-year-old 
son named Ian. Prior to moving 
out west, Dave worked for the 
Brooklyn D.A.'s office and the 
law firm of Wachtell Lipton. 

Harold Ullman, a tax attorney 
for the firm Curtis Mallet in New 
York, got his J.D. at Columbia and 
received his L.L.M. in tax from 
NYU. He is married to Stacey 
Pomerantz and they have a 
daughter, Rachel. Harold had 
worked for Baker & McKenzie in 
Washington, D.C. prior to return¬ 
ing to New York. 

Robert Beranek took a slightly 
circuitous route to legal practice. 
After college he worked for a 
defense contracting firm for two 
years. He then took his computer 
programming skills to Malawi in 
the Peace Corps. Bob got to 
travel through most of southern 
Africa and Asia. He then worked 
for Congressman Jim Olin of 
Virginia in Washington, D.C. 
before going to the University of 
Chicago law school. He has just 
started to work for the Chicago 
firm of Winston & Strawn. 

Bruce Shapiro practices corpo¬ 
rate law at Gordon Altman 
Butowsky Weitzer Shalov & 

Wein. He and his wife Gail have 
a two-year-old named Zachary. 

Jon White, after graduating 
from Columbia Law, worked as an 
associate at Patterson Belknap. He 
now runs his family's coffee roast¬ 
ing and distribution company. He 
is married to Allison Breitbart B'85 
and they have a son. 

I am assistant counsel for the 
New York State Housing Finance 
Agency and the NYS Medical 
Care Facilities Finance Agency. I 
got my J.D. from Columbia and 
continued at Columbia to study 
urban planning. After graduating 
I worked at Skadden Arps as a 
corporate banking attorney. I 
now do public finance in the 
areas of affordable housing and 
health care facilities. I also am 
active in pro bono work for 
Lawyers Alliance for New York 
and the City Bar. 

Brian Cousin has been active 
with the reunion committee and 
is currently an associate at the 
New York office of Baker & 
McKenzie. Brian Margolis, after 
graduating from Harvard Law 
and Business, is now an associate 
in New York for Weil, Gotshal & 
Manges. 

Aaron Freiwald is the author 
of The Last Nazi, a book about 
Josef Schwammberger, who may 
be the last Nazi brought to prose¬ 


cution for crimes against human¬ 
ity. Aaron, after stints at the Legal 
Times and American Lawyer, is 
now attending law school at the 
University of Pennsylvania. 

We also have a fair share of 
doctors. Lane Palmer is a uro- 
logic surgeon at the Montefiore 
Medical Center in the Bronx. 

Lane got his M.D. from Yeshiva's 
Albert Einstein College of 
Medicine. He is married to Lisa 
Menasse-Palmer and they have a 
girl named Samantha. Lane will 
finish his residency in 1995 and 
then will start a fellowship in 
pediatric urology at Chicago 
Children's Memorial. 

Martin Moskowitz is a resi¬ 
dent in general surgery at 
Maimonides Medical Center in 
Brooklyn. Martin is married to 
Boni and they have two children 
(a boy and a girl). He received 
his M.D. at Rutgers and will be 
extending his training with a res¬ 
idency in plastic surgery at 
Baylor in Houston. 

Robert Gardella is a psychia¬ 
trist and an assistant professor of 
psychiatric medicine at the 
University of Virginia, where he 
also received his M.D. He is mar¬ 
ried to Dr. Lynn E. Gardella. 

Noah Sabin received his J.D. 
from Boston College and then 
decided to attend medical school 
at SUNY-Buffalo after several 
classes on law, medicine and 
public policy classes stoked his 
desire to become a physician. He 
is active in the American Medical 
Students Association, particularly 
in its legislative affairs task force. 

Other classmates are involved 
in business pursuits. Mark 
Singer is a senior portfolio man¬ 
ager with Sanford C. Bernstein & 
Co. and sings with the Magic 
Circle Opera (resident opera com¬ 
pany at La Mama, etc.) When he 
wrote us, he was planning to 
marry Darcy Dunn on July 28. He 
has performed in several operas 
and was favorably reviewed for 
his performance as the toreador 
in Bizet's Carmen in October 1993. 

Evan Ratner is an associate at 
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. He 
married Susan Jill Scheman B'86

First of all, how 'bout those 
Lions? Indeed! I caught the sea- 
son-ender against Brown with 
Kevin Toner, expecting to see 
much from the first winning sea¬ 
son since 1971. We arrived just 
before halftime to see a "new" 
Columbia up by over three 
touchdowns, only to see our boys 
give up over 50 points in the sec¬ 
ond half and end up getting 
mauled. Now, either I'm a jinx (I 
have never seen a winning 
Columbia game), or them boys 
gotta LONG way to go.

How 'bout them Lions? I trotted 
out to Baker for the Brown game, 
only to witness the football team 
bleed light blue all over the turf, 
going down big to the Bruins. 

The memories were a little too 
vivid, but still, by all accounts 
(mine being the most important), 
the Class of '88 is thrilled with 
the success of the football pro¬ 
gram: we cheer the loudest. 

(Mike Henry '89 wanted desper¬ 
ately to be included in the '88 
cheering section). It's been a long 
road for the Lions; let's keep the 
magic alive. 

Speaking of long roads, Liz 
King postcarded me with news 
that she's back in Prague from 
South Africa. Heartbroken at 
missing reunion, she wants us all 
to "CompuServe" her at mailbox 
100277, 2401. This only reaffirms 
my status as a signpost on the 
information superhighway. 

Ramona Prioleau just gradu¬ 
ated from Virginia Law and will 
be working for Brown & Wood in 
N.Y.C. I get the feeling that 
Ramona will be putting her C.U. 
MBA to work in some tax/busi¬ 
ness-related field. Maybe she can 
help me balance my checkbook. 

The great Steve Stastny 
updated me on the peregrinations 
of his legal career. Stas is now an 
associate with Lehr Middlebrooks 
in Birmingham, Ala., doing labor 
law. Roll Tide. John Calandra is 
also "doin' the law thang" with 
McDermott Will & Emory in New 
York. He's a hard-nosed litigator 
there. 

In a reverse move. Marten 
Hirsch has left the law. Yes, that's 
right, ladies and gentlemen. 
Marten Hirsh has left the law (just 
like me). There is hope for our 
generation. Marten is now v.p. for 
Resources, Inc., an infomercial 
start-up. Coincidentally, it was a 
letter from John Etra that alerted 
me to the news. John has not left 
the law and consequently gets a 
much smaller write-up. He's still 
at Weil, Gotshal. 

Mark Loebenberg married 
Lays Herman in Rochester, and 
there was much rejoicing. He's an 
ortho resident at Strong 
Memorial.

MY WEDDING REPORTS: 1 had the 
extreme pleasure of attending 
Dure Savini's nuptials. Dure mar¬ 
ried the now Mrs. Savini, Janeen, 
on November 26. The ceremony 
and Janeen were both beautiful. 


and Dure was a beaming groom. 

Attendees included: Mike 
Bissinger, who helped me get 
thrown out of not one, but two 
bars (his fiancee Kristin 
Friedholm '90 gave up on us by 
the second); Mike Lavelle, whose 
footloose and fancy-free, fun- 
lovin' wife Maura kept him on 
the dance floor for just one more 
disco song; Scott Fabean and his 
lovely wife; the long-suffering 
Drew Krause, who received the 
loudest applause of the wedding 
party; and non-'88er's George 
Stone '87, Jim Taylor '89, and 
Matt "Oogie" Engels '89, 

Ah, how I love a wedding— 
the drinks are on the house. In 
closing I want to wish my dear 
friends Dure and Janeen a life¬ 
time of accomplishment and an 
eternity of happiness. 

Next up: sweet Nick Leone 
and fiancee Grace Koo.

Amos Tuck School 
Hanover, N.H. 03755 

Greetings, classmates, from the 
Amos Tuck School of Business 
Administration in bucolic 
Hanover. I thought the switch 
from the Big Apple to country liv¬ 
ing would add years to my life. 
But it's not working out that way. 
Instead, Tm trying my darnedest 
not to low pass all my classes. I 
must be in class by 8 a.m. I'm 
lucky if I get six hours of sleep a 
night. I have ever-larger and 
darker circles under my eyes. 

And the burdensome work load 
has forced me to cut down on my 
alcohol intake. Nonetheless, Tm 
learning a ton, I exercise more 
than ever, I can see the stars at 
night, and my classmates are 
really cool. 

Three other Columbians are 
here with me at Tuck: Chris 
Amirian '86, John Beasley III 
GS'92 and Charles Preusse. 
Thinking about Tuck? Give us a 
call! Ah yes... there is at least one 
other Columbian here at Tuck, 
and he is Professor Paul Argenti 
'75. To all his classmates, he is 
doing a fine job teaching us 
Managerial Communications; 
however, I shall refrain from fur¬ 
ther comments until 1 see my 
final grade for the course. 

Having written the last column 
alphabetically, 1 shall structure 
this one geographically. First, 

Lisa Landau and Liz Pleshette 
came up for the Columbia- 
Dartmouth football game, where 
we ran into the likes of the 
Endelman brothers and Ian 
Wenniger. Columbia lost a close 
game. We were sad. But we con¬ 
gratulate the team on their win¬ 
ning season. Now that we have a 
winning football team, we may

want to consider "restructuring" 
the band. I laud the band's spirit, 
but perhaps we should add more 
traditional instruments to the 
line-up and lose some of the more 
innovative instruments (like the 
wok). Admittedly, though, I loved 
the band's rendition of the hora, 
and the highlight of the game 
may very well have been when a 
very brave President Rupp 
formed the top of the band's 
human pyramid! 

In Boston, we find Lee 
Feldman, attorney extraordi¬ 
naire, who graduated from 
Boston University in 1993. While 
he enjoys his work, it regrettably 
kept him from attending Reunion 
Weekend. Lee's sister, Philippa 
B'90, whom many of us remem¬ 
ber as R.A. on Carman 8, is now 
president of the Varsity "C" 

Club. Anyone else in Boston? 

That Wharton MBA, William 
Woo '88, having completed a 
whirlwind tour of Asia, has 
moved to Boston, where he's 
working for Advent International 
Corporation and is looking to get 
together with fellow Columbians 
who recognize Boston's merits, 
but also its shortfalls, at least in 
comparison to New York. 

Towards the end of the sum¬ 
mer, I had the good fortune of 
running into Joanna Usher 
Silver in Soho, on Broadway, a 
mere 118 blocks south of where 
we first met. You may have 
guessed from her new name that 
Joanna got married. Joanna grad¬ 
uated from Yale's School of 
Management two springs ago, 
where she met her husband, 
David. She enjoys satisfying 
work with the Metropolitan 
Council on Housing, where she 
endeavors to eliminate poverty 
in N.Y.C. 

Rob Kresberg has been named 
coach of the women's tennis 
team. We know Rob will do a 
fantastic job, owing to his enthu¬ 
siasm for Columbia, his experi¬ 
ence as captain, his part in cap¬ 
turing the Ivy title (zillions of 
years ago!) and his international 
touring experience. We suspect 
the women's team will capture 
their own title soon...like this 
spring, Rob? Ilona Nemeth com¬ 
plains she is getting tired of tak¬ 
ing taxis to airports. Rest 
assured, Ilona is still the glam¬ 
orous and international jet setter 
she always was. When not at her 
desk at Goldman doing "hybrid" 
sales and trading stuff, she's trav¬ 
eling between Paris and New 
York. She claims to find New 
York a bit boring these days but 
admits that she might be out of 
the loop. In her free time. Miss 
Ilona can be found throwing left 
hooks at the Wall Street Boxing 
Club. She's hoping to graduate to 
tae kwon do. Yikes! Let's hope 


these aren't the skills required for 
Wall Street. Nick Herman reports 
he is playing bongos with 
Orquesta Tropicana, the salsa 
concern, and percussion for the 
Firefishers, an "alternative-rock 
band." Nick also works on his 
own music and is working for 
the Fund for Modern Courts, 
which aims to improve and 
reform the New York court sys¬ 
tem. Chris Reohr is working 
hard at McKinsey, which he 
joined in March 1993 (his first 
job, mind you). Just prior to 
becoming a productive member 
of society, Chris spent six months 
filling in the gaps in his core edu¬ 
cation, reading Kafka and 
Nietzsche. I forgot to ask Chris if 
he reads Nietzsche in German. I 
know that Michael Madrid and 
Michael Block '91 and probably 
numerous Germans do. 

Congratulations to Naomi 
Hanser, who graduated from 
Mount Sinai Medical School last 
spring. She has begun her resi¬ 
dency at Montefiore Hospital in 
the Bronx. I gleaned such note¬ 
worthy news from Michael 
Young, whom I coerced into hav¬ 
ing a cup of coffee with me as far 
back as last spring. All that 
stands in the way of his Ph.D. 
from NYU are his oral exams and 
dissertation. 

At the time of reunion, Jeff 
Udell promised to give me a full 
report on the marriage of 
Michael Schrag and Andrea 
Franchett. First things first, 
though. Jeff began a new job this 
fall at the Office of the Appellate 
Defender. For the non-legal types 
out there, myself included, his 
new office is like Legal Aid, but 
for appeals. As for the wedding, 
it took place in Berkeley Hills at 
Mike's dad's house. (We're on 
the California section now.) Jeff 
reports there were spectacular 
views overlooking San Fran and 
Oakland. The groom is pursuing 
a joint degree at Berkeley in pub¬ 
lic policy and law. Andrea has 
plans to go to medical school in 
the near future. In attendance at 
the wedding was David 
Streitfeld, who is hanging out in 
San Francisco and playing a lot 
of guitar. Ethan Nosowsky flew 
in from New York, where he is an 
editor for a publishing concern. 
Adina Safer B'89, Molly Hansen 
B'89, and Robyn Graft B'89, who 
herself just got married, were in 
attendance, too. You may be 
wondering, where was Erik 
Price? He was there, of course, 
but is deserving of his own gloss. 
Erik's recent engagement party 
turned out to be the wedding 
itself, a surprise to even the 
groom's parents, reports Jeff. 
Mazel tov to Erik and Paula. 
Having earned a journalism 
degree from Berkeley, Erik works 



Jill Tannenbaum '89 has been 
named to the new position of 
vice president/healthcare market¬ 
ing at Bozell Public Relations in 
New York. With expertise in car¬ 
diovascular and antiviral drugs, 
vaccines, diagnostics, and infec¬ 
tious diseases, Ms. Tannenbaum 
previously managed several 
accounts at Creamer Dickson 
Basford for the pharmaceutical 
firm of SmithKline Beecham. She 
helped launch Famvir, a drug for 
treating shingles, and the 
Engerix-B vaccine used against 
hepatitis B. 

A native of Roslyn Heights, 
N.Y., Ms. Tannenbaum now lives 
in Manhattan, where she is active 
in Columbia's Career Services 
and mentoring programs. 


for the athletic department there, 
where he is an "eligibility spe¬ 
cialist." Also in California is 
Barbara Rosenthal. Babs is work¬ 
ing for J.P. Morgan in L.A. We 
missed her at Reunion; she was 
taking the second level of the 
C.F.A. exam (she passed!). 

Barbara is involved in several 
non-profit gigs, her main one 
being Performing Tree, an L.A.- 
based arts-in-education organiza¬ 
tion. She is also active with the 
Southern California alumni 
group, where she met Joel 
Mendias at an alumni barbecue. 
Joel, who hails from East Texas, 
is working in film in L.A. The 
BBQ, according to Babs, was a 
"crack-up" and "cute," probably 
because incoming first-years 
were present. Ace reports that 
Jay Timmer continues with his 
"Nobel style" bio-chem research 
at Berkeley. Incidentally, Gina 
Shishima said she saw a slide of 
Jay at the "Genetics of Sex" con¬ 
ference this past spring at 
Princeton. What's that all about. 
Jay? A Ph.D. in molecular biology 
is not enough for Miss Gina. She 
is looking to attend law school 
next fall! Need a good patent 
lawyer? 

Todd "H. Toad" Thomason has 
left the Big Apple for St. Louis, 


Mo.; we hear he's happy back in 
the Midwest, where he can go 
"fishin' an' huntin'." Even more 
exciting news was the announce¬ 
ment of Todd's fall engagement to 
Allison Karmel. The two met in 
grad school at Chicago, where 
Todd earned his MBA, and plan 
to marry this fall. Todd says he 
can see the Arch from his cubicle 
at A. G. Edwards, the investment 
banking concern. His new car, he 
claims, is Columbia blue and has 
a hood ornament in the shape of a 
lion. A while back, Todd visited 
Doug Teasdale at his new house; 
Doug's a lawyer in St. Louis, hav¬ 
ing graduated from Washington 
University. During Todd's visit, 
Doug impressed Todd with his 
Columbia cross-country award, 
which was the focal point of the 
room, displayed prominently on 
top of the telly. 

I have but one person to report 
on in the South; surely we have 
others in Dixie—let us know 
you're all O.K. Michael Young 
reports that Jon Riker is at 
Tulane, earning himself a 
J.D./M.A. in anthropology. Did I 
ever mention 1 do an excellent 
monkey impersonation? As 
promised, I have a full report on 
the summer wedding of Seth 
Antiles and Janete Kizer '92 in 
Caracas (Lee Feldman was kind 
enough to provide details). The 
dancing—merengue and tradi¬ 
tional dances like the hora—was 
"out of control," lasting 'til five 
in the morning. Apparently, not a 
word of English was exchanged 
during the ceremony, just a com¬ 
bination of Spanish and Hebrew. 
Would Max Parra be proud of 
Seth or what? The "relevant play¬ 
ers" in attendance were, as 
expected, Jamie Mercado, Omar 
Kodmani, Mark Pineda, Justin 
O'Grady, Delores Wilson, 
Devand Sukhdeo. 

Congratulations to Dolores and 
Devand, too, who were recently 
married. Dan Loflin has more 
Columbia gossip than anyone I 
know. He informed me of the 
wedding and reported having 
had a splendid time at the D&D 
wedding. Dan was in the midst of 
Kellogg's recruiting season when 
we last spoke, and for the record, 
he seemed to be masterfully jug¬ 
gling numerous management 
consulting firms. You go Dan! Far 
East news: Apparently, Cravath 
opened an office in Hong Kong, 
and Kaivan M. Shakib has been 
posted there for a period of 
roughly 18 months. If you're in 
the neighborhood, why not give 
him a call at 852-509-7210? 

That's it! Nada mas. I won't 
take offense (yet) that none of 
you— barring my parents, of 
course—write, call, fax, or e-mail. 
But you can atone. It's good net¬ 
working. Long live the science

It's been a long time since CCT 
has heard anything from the Class 
of '90. However, with our five- 
year reunion approaching in June 
(has it really been five years since 
graduation?), our classmates have 
flooded the CCT offices with 
news. The outpouring began 
when reunion plans were 
launched last June. Therefore, 
some of this information is dated. 
But let's get it all in. This is our 
POWER issue. 

Randi Albert and Dan Halevy 
are engaged. Randi is set to grad¬ 
uate from Harvard Law in June 
and has already applied her skills 
at the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau. 
Isabel Arista just started law 
school in Boston last August at 
B.U. Isabel will be missed in New 
York City, where she was a social 
worker. Paul Barnes reports that 
he is now a lieutenant in the U.S. 
Army, stationed in Korea. He has 
been studying Russian. Davis 
Bloch received his J.D. from Penn 
and now clerks for a judge at the 
Middlesex County Court in New 
Brunswick, N.J. Scott Buitekant 
is engaged to Betsy Ann Mosiello 
and is working towards his MBA 
at NYU. Ed Chen is an intern at 
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical 
Center. He earned his M.D. at 
Johns Hopkins. 

Jeffrey Comuniello graduated 
from the SUNY Health Science 
Center of Brooklyn and will be 
doing his internship at Staten 
Island University Hospital and 
his residency in anesthesiology at 
Mount Sinai Medical Center in 
New York. Labrini Dalamangas 
graduated from New Jersey 
Medical School and is currently 
interning at Overlook Hospital, a 
Columbia-affiliated community 
hospital. She will begin her anes¬ 
thesiology residency at Duke 
Medical Center this year. Naomi 
Gendler enrolled in a joint 
degree program at Harvard com¬ 
bining law and government and 
she expects to graduate with 
both degrees in 1997. She just 
returned from three years in 
Thailand working with the U.S. 
Refugee Program Bureau and 
spent last summer in Harvard's 
project on economic reform in 
Ukraine. Wendy Hayward is 
now a CPA seeking her master's 
in taxation at Golden Gate 
University. In her spare time she 
works on her garden, her black 
belt in tae kwan do, and her golf 


game. John Johmann is vice 
president of a small public rela¬ 
tions firm. Savvy Management 
Public Relations. He relates that 
Monica Lahiri has a beautiful 
daughter, Alexandra, and is now 
living in Stanford and seeking a 
master's degree. John also tells 
us that Luisa Linares is pursuing 
her law degree in Miami and that 
Sean Martin is pursuing a Ph.D. 
in history. 

J. T. Knight, director of one of 
the finest short films in history 
(Stan McCloy, Jr. and 1 starred in 
it) received his J.D. from the 
University of Wisconsin. Anette 
Kreipke finished her master's in 
international affairs at Columbia 
in 1991, worked for a year in 
Indonesia, and then came back to 
Columbia for her third Columbia 
degree, in business. Adam Levitt 
is an attorney with Wilk & Waller 
in Chicago. He got his J.D. at 
Northwestern. Paulette Light is a 
consultant at the Center for 
Applied Research, where she 
applies her assorted degrees from 
Columbia, Harvard and 
Wharton. The 1-way led David 
Marlin from Boston back to 
Columbia Business School. David 
worked in Boston as a software 
engineer for IDX Systems. Track 
star Devon Martin now sports a 
Fulbright scholarship on her 
resume. She is studying ancient 
cartography and the topography 
of Roman Britain at Oxford 
University. Dianne Nelson keeps 
in touch with Julie Bibb, Julie 
Fishman and Dianna Semel (and 
Moira Regelson and Catherine 
Metcalf, both B'90) via an e-mail 
"coffee talk" while she works 
toward her Ph.D. in linguistics at 
the University of Edinburgh. 
Charles Preusse worked for S. G. 
Warburg in New York and 
London last summer. He'll be 
completing his MBA at the Amos 
Tuck School at Dartmouth this 
year. Teresa Rice has been quite 
the world traveler, living for two 
years in Mexico City, visiting 
Cuba, then moving to Bologna, 
Italy, where she started the first 
year of her master's program in 
advanced international studies. 
She completed the second year in 
Washington, D.C. before working 
on an international park project 
in the Amazon. She plans on 
eventually coming back to New 
York to start work. (Yeah right, 
she says.) Alice Rice is a free¬ 
lance writer and columnist doing 
celebrity interviews and con¬ 
sumer reporting. Trisha Suggs is 
very happy still to be involved 
with basketball. She is an adviser 
for women's athletics at the 
University of Rhode Island. 
Patricia Sullivan scored a job 
with the Manhattan D.A.'s office 
after finishing up at Fordham 


Law last May. Christine Tan is a 
programmer/analyst at Goldman 
Sachs and Anne Taranto is cur¬ 
rently a Ph.D. candidate in the 
English department at Yale. 
Gemma Tarlach is slogging 
through full-time Russian lan¬ 
guage training as a foreign ser¬ 
vice officer with the Department 
of State. Soon she will be ship¬ 
ping out to Moscow for a two- 
year tour as a consular officer at 
the embassy. Her shameless plug: 
she's got a short story, "Black 
Wolf," which was published 
shortly after graduation in Sword 
and Sorceress VI, a paperback 
anthology edited by Marion 
Zimmer Bradley. Buy a copy and 
Gemma gets 4 cents in royalties. 
Greg Torborg represents profes¬ 
sional athletes and sports teams 
in his work with Gibney, 

Anthony and Flaherty. He gradu¬ 
ated from Fordham Law in 1994. 
Marion Wright just returned 
from a 14-month world tour of 
the U.S., Australia, Indonesia, 
Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, 
Hong Kong and Japan. He stayed 
with Jenny Thompson in Tokyo, 
who, he says, is doing well, but 
working very hard running the 
Tokyo office of an international 
shipping company. 

George Boulukos claims that 
he is working hard to obtain his 
Ph.D. at the University of Texas 
in the English department. Sean 
Flynn reports that he survived 
fires, earthquakes, floods, land¬ 
slides, evictions and car accidents 
in Southern California. German 
Gomez graduated from Fordham 
Law and works with a solo prac¬ 
titioner in Brooklyn as a personal 
injury lawyer. Matt Less is teach¬ 
ing high school math and coach¬ 
ing football, basketball, and base¬ 
ball in Kansas City. Matt is mar¬ 
ried to fourth-grade teacher 
Julene Collins. Peter Meier is 
completing law school at the 
University of California at Davis. 
Rich Minich was making short 
films in Berlin for the last few 
years and had planned to return 
to California last September to 
finish up his graduate studies. 
Lynn Murphy is a physical edu¬ 
cation teacher at the Bradley 
School in California. William 
Peng is really enjoying working 
in Hong Kong for Citibank. He 
says that Hong Kong is a vibrant, 
efficient and cosmopolitan city 
without the filth and crime of 
New York, but, of course, he 
sometimes misses the cultural life 
of the Big Apple. Gregory Palega 
graduated from Cornell Medical 
College last May and he is now a 
resident in internal medicine at 
Duke University Medical Center. 
John Pennekamp received his 
J.D. from Florida State, served as 
a law clerk for Judge Fay of the 


11th Circuit, and now practices in 
Miami, primarily in the admi¬ 
ralty field. Elizabeth Phythian is 
director of Score! Advantage 
Centers, which runs interactive 
learning centers for kids in Palo 
Alto, Calif. Vera Scanlon is at 
Yale Law School. She worked for 
Hughes, Hubbard & Reed in 
New York last summer, and 
researched human rights issues 
in Ireland. Fred Schultz gradu¬ 
ated from Georgetown Law in 
May. Ben Seligman graduated 
from Rutgers Law and has been 
writing and editing for the New 
Legist: Magazine of Modern Law, 
published by James Marks '86. 
Jeremy Simon graduated from 
NYU Medical School and 
received a fellowship to study 
medical ethics. For myself, 1 love 
working at McManimon & 
Scotland, a great firm in beautiful 
downtown Newark. (Newark is 
actually not so bad.) 

Looks like big things lie ahead 
for the five-year bash. Many peo¬ 
ple are getting involved, and 
nearly all of the people men¬ 
tioned above have indicated that 
they will be attending. 1 will defi¬ 
nitely be at the reunion and 1 
hope to see you all there, too.

Sorry if this makes you feel 
crummy and depressed, but by 
the time you read this, you will 
have spent almost as much time 
with your college degree as you 
did desperately trying to earn it 
(unless you were one of those 
people on that five-year-plus 
plan). So, ask yourself: Have you 
been holding fast to the spirit of 
youth? Have you read any new 
Thucydides lately? Have you had 
time to ponder the wisdom of 
that tragic guy Sophocles? And 
what about Kant? Have you 
cracked the spine of his really, 
really big and confusing book? 
Have you been to a Columbia 
Lions football game yet? Just 
remember: College isn't four 
years, it's a bunch of bills that 
will keep on coming for a long 
time unless you were at St. A's. 

Before 1 rip open that big and 
crusty mail bag (and pray that 
it's not something from the 
Unabomber), 1 must issue a dis¬ 
claimer. Because of several angry 
letters and hurt feelings from a 
couple of classmates whom 1 
respect, 1 feel it necessary to say 
that this is penned (word- 
processed really) in the spirit of 
good, clean fun. Our column is 
meant to be a wacky and light¬ 
hearted look at what all of us are 
doing or not doing. Tattoo this on 
your back and have your signifi-

cant other read it to you when¬ 
ever a new issue of this magazine 
arrives: If I ever seem too glib, 
just remember that I'm probably 
a bigger loser than you and your 
friends. Also be thankful that I 
don't use the first person plural. 

If I bug you now, just hope that 
maybe one day. I'll be our class's 
Bob Lipsyte '57 and you'll boast 
to everyone how you knew me 
back in the 20th century. 

Onward. 

Poor Stephen Jansen. He sent 
me a great letter that didn't make 
it into the last issue because of 
this magazine's strict deadline. 

So he sent me another long, 
handwritten letter. Steph is with 
Wertheim Schroder, a mid-sized 
investment bank, where he 
works in the risk arbitrage 
department as an analyst. 
Although he is having fun, Steph 
has decided on returning to 
school to get an MBA this fall. 
While Steph was vacationing in 
San Francisco, he visited his 
froshling roommate Andrew 
Haave, who started Stanford 
Business School this fall. I 
already have a sneaking suspi¬ 
cion about who our class's 
trustees will be in 40 years... 
Steph bumped into Jen Kirby 
(who, like me, survived our scary 
floor on John Jay in 1987-88) and 
learned that Jen is now in her 
third year of law school... 
Elizabeth Butrick sent me a nice 
letter from Nicaragua, where she 
was working as a Peace Corps 
volunteer and helping prove that 
the spirit of volunteerism didn't 
end with Grayson Kirk's reign at 
Columbia. Elizabeth was sched¬ 
uled to end her tour of duty in 
the former Sandinista bastion this 
past December. This year, she 
plans to work for Save the 
Children or perhaps just spend 
some time exploring Latin 
America... Laura Sylvester 
mailed in her news a while back 
on a really cute notecard with 
parrots. She said she's been liv¬ 
ing in L.A. for the past two years 
and was accepted into the 
Director's Guild's training pro¬ 
gram. Laura would "love to hear 
from other Columbians working 
in the film business. I'm listed in 
the phone book." Ah! the sweet 
smell of networking... Another 
rising star in the business (as 
they say in Hollywood) is John 
Griffin, who once cast me as 
Dean Lehecka for his soap opera 
on CTV. John now is an associate 
producer at the A&E network. 
How about an entire Biography 
episode on Roger Lehecka? The 
previous news nugget was 
brought to you by Michael 
Feldschuh, who is working for 
Morgan Stanley in London as a 
derivatives broker. Michael also 


tells me that Patrick Flynn has 
abandoned banking for law 
school at NYU; that Jon O'Neill 
is out of law school and looking 
for a job; and that Hugh Lawson 
is finishing up his second year in 
Yale Law School. 

Tina Fitzgerald is great simply 
because she regularly sends 
splendid letters updating me on 
different cliques of people. I 
hereby make her an honorary 
West Coast class groupie and 
promise to buy her a beer (or the 
libation of her choice) if she ever 
makes it back to NYC. Sorry, 

Tina, because of legal obligations, 
I can't print your e-mail address. 
Tina writes that Craig Box, who 
lived across the hall from her in 
Carman back in the go-go 80's, is 
working for a New York law 
firm. Tina has spotted Brian 
Derro on the hallowed grounds 
of UCLA, where he is in the 
Ph.D. program for physics. Tina 
writes: "I'm pretty darn sure I 
saw Cameron Port across a 
crowded campus eatery. Brian 
corroborated my sighting, sort of, 
by saying: 'Yeah, I heard she was 
here.'" How's that for an update, 
Cameron? Tina has also heard 
that Kate McIntyre is getting a 
Ph.D. in geology at U.C.-Santa 
Cruz. She also writes that Ran 
Satija is in law school at the 
University of Texas. 

Heather Lubov and Josh 
Taylor '92 continued their torrid 
campus romance by getting mar¬ 
ried last summer. Heather is 
working for the New York Public 
Library and Josh is working for 
the Partnership for the Homeless. 
Both work in publicity. Josh was 
kind enough to invite me to his 
bachelor party where the high¬ 
light (or lowlight) occurred when 
his friends handcuffed his leg to 
a ball and a chain at an Upper 
West Side bar... Annmarie 
Giarratano left her 100-hour-a- 
week job a Lehman Brothers for a 
"very relaxing new job" at 
Clinique. Ann notes that her 
roommate Jodi Williams works 
at NBC and helps produce the 
news for the weekend Today 
show. Beth Shubin Stein is in 
her third year at Columbia P&S 
and Julie Levy is finishing up at 
Yale Law, while Elise Scheck is 
hitting the law briefs at Miami... 
Besides having one of the niftiest 
names in our class, Warren St. 
John is writing an entertaining 
column about New York's courts 
in the city's peach-colored 
weekly. The Observer. Warren's 
column is well worth paying a 
buck for the paper and it also 
proves that you don't need to go 
to law school to write about liti¬ 
gation. Samuel Helfrich and 
Bevin McLaughlin were among 
the many '91ers spotted by my 


spies at a pre-NYC Marathon 
party. Neither was running in the 
race, however. Sam had decided 
on going to law school at NYU 
while Bevin was temping until 
she figured out what to do with 
the rest of her life. Bevin was 
among the non-runners who later 
danced her legs off at a SoHo 
club named "Bob" along with 
Justin Lundgren (despite the fact 
that Justin's Barnard sweetheart 
Kiersta was running in the 
marathon the next day). Justin 
and Kiersta are living in New 
Orleans; he is planning on going 
to med school this fall... Last but 
not least: I saw Andrew Dunn 
walking around the streets of 
New York in June. Andy (another 
survivor of my wretched floor 
freshman year): please write, we 
miss you. Max Whitney had a 
few beers with me and Dave 
Kunian '92 this fall. Reliable 
sources tell me that Alexis 
Dudden is at U. Chicago studying 
Japanese and doing quite well... 
Against all reasonable judgment, 

I am forcing this column off the 
rutted dirt road that we are trav¬ 
eling on and merging it onto the 
Information Superhighway. If you 
are too lazy to mail a letter to my 
home office in Slingerlands, 
e-mail me at bobmagic@aol.com. 

I already see us bringing the 
nation's computer infrastructure 
to its knees...

Well, it's funny what a plea for 
help in this space does to my 
mailbox. Thanks for all of you 
who wrote to update me on your 
doings. I'm sure I'll get even 
more letters from you after my 
due date, but keep 'em coming. 
All the better for next issue. 

A number of 1992'ers have 
come home to campus, enrolling 
in various graduate programs. 
Columbia Law School welcomed 
Sarah Wolman, Elizabeth Reza 
and Shawn Lese to its halls this 
September. Jean Lee returned 
from her stint in Korea to spend 
a year at Columbia Journalism 
School. Donna Myers will begin 
a program at Columbia Business 
School in January 1995. Her hus¬ 
band, Aaron Lebovitz, was 
recently promoted to an associate 
position at Prudential Securities. 

Nick Cheonis wrote to tell me 
that he is now the assistant editor 
of the Hudson Review in Manhattan 
and can be reached by any of his 
old classmates at that publication. 

Andy Treitel tells me that he 
will be clerking for the Supreme 
Court of Israel upon his gradua¬ 
tion from Columbia Law School. 



Andy also said that Jeff Kobrin 
recently got engaged to Michelle 
Greenberg '94. Jeff had spent two 
years in Israel getting a rabbini¬ 
cal degree and is now pursuing a 
master's in English at Columbia. 
Noam Ohring was recently mar¬ 
ried to Yaffa Regosin B'93. Saul 
Richter traded in his suits and 
long hours at Smith Barney for, 
in Andy's words, a more pleasant 
lifestyle at Dubois Brown & Co. 
Andy, Jeff, Noam, and Saul were 
all at the wedding of another 
classmate, Johnny Shippel, who 
married Adina Wassner. Andy 
reported a wide range of person¬ 
alities at the wedding, including 
a host of Hasidic rabbis and the 
Archbishop of Los Angeles. 

Another law school classmate, 
Ben Lawsky, filled me in on more 
of our classmates' goings on. Ben 
will be clerking for Judge Amon 
in New York's Eastern District 
next year but will spend his sum¬ 
mer working in the civil division 
of the Department of Justice. 

Dave Aserkoff has moved to 
London and is working for First 
Boston there. Rob Goldman is a 
first-year law student at UCLA. 
Josh Siegel is still working in the 
film department at MOMA. 
According to Ben, Josh has orga¬ 
nized some "really cool exhibits." 
Sara Hall is a Ph.D. candidate in 
German Studies at Berkeley, 
where she is currently teaching a 
German I class. Apparently, Sara, 
Josh, Rob, and Dara-Lynn Weiss 
'91 all met up and went to Las 
Vegas together recently. 

Dave Goldberg is working for 
Interfid Capital in New York 
City. Chris Watanabe is still in 
Japan, where he is contemplating 
graduate school either in that 
country or the U.S. Lydia Breck 
B'92 is working for the Federal 
Reserve and is now applying to 
business school. Marcy 
Aldersberg is continuing her 
medical studies at Cornell, and 
Amanda Schoenberg is doing 
the same at Columbia. 

Finally, I got a letter from Tina 
Fitzgerald '91, who took pity on 
my empty mailbag and gave me 
some tidbits about our class¬ 
mates. Tina wrote that Jake 
Martin is in his first year at the 
UCLA English department, 
where he is a Ph.D. candidate. 
Max Winter is at Washington 
University in St. Louis, also pur¬ 
suing a Ph.D. in English litera¬ 
ture. Tina also reported that she 
saw Tim Griffin and his band, El 
Sicko, at the New Music Cafe on 
Canal Street in New York. The 
band plays a combination of jazz, 
funk, and hip-hop, and is quite 
good, according to Tina. 

As for me. I'm now officially 
staying in New York after my 
graduation from Columbia Law.

Columbia College Today 


ril be working at a firm called 
Proskauer, Rose, Goetz & 
Mendelsohn. While I still have 
time, however. I'm trying to live 
by the credo inscribed on the fire¬ 
place in John Jay Hall: "Hold fast 
to the spirit of youth, let years to 
come do what they may." I hope 
all of you are doing the same.

Many thanks to Aileen Torres for 
saving this space from the dark 
pit of hiatus-land with her fasci¬ 
nating letter of travels abroad. 
After touring 13 cities across the 
United States from Washington, 
D.C. to Mobile, Ala., to New 
Orleans and Pensacola, she 
joined classmate Linda Ayala in 
San Antonio, Texas and returned 
to Corpus Christi, Aileen's home¬ 
town. The duo decided to ven¬ 
ture into Mexico to visit the capi¬ 
tal city and then the southern 
state of Oaxaca. 

Aileen then went on an "eco- 
adventure" with friends in 
Puerto Rico and Costa Rica 
before heading to Buenos Aires, 
London, southern France and 
Spain. "I really miss the diversity 
of Columbia," she said as her jus¬ 
tification. When she wasn't hav¬ 
ing her passport stamped, Aileen 
worked as a bilingual educator 
for ESL at her old junior high 
school. Then she came to New 
York to work for a software- 
developing company called Q-M, 
a Microsoft partner, where she 
was a diligent chip in the vast 
electronic empire of Bill Gates. 
And now Aileen is waiting to 
decide where to go to law school. 
From one Texan to another, 
jAdelante! 

In the first chain letter written 
for this column. Bob Hardt, the 
estimable correspondent for the 
Class of '91, and I shared a note 
from Susanna Wood '91 and 
Jennifer Sandman, both of whom 
are working for the Peace Corps 
in Turkmenistan in the former 
Soviet Union. 

From the beaches of the 
Caspian Sea, where the two were 
spending a holiday, Jennifer 
reported that Amy Longo is a 
first-year student at Columbia 
Law. Daniel Seda is working at 
an institute for the disabled and is 
living in the Bronx. Anna Levine, 
who at the time I received this let¬ 
ter was a "very pregnant" Anna 
Levine, is probably now a very 
busy Anna Levine, living and 
working in Japan with her hus¬ 
band Sado. Judy Wong is teach¬ 
ing English in Beijing and plan¬ 
ning to enter Columbia Law in 
the fall. Mark Macintosh is living 
in Greenwich Village and work¬ 


ing in the D.A.'s office as a legal 
assistant. Jason Daley is also in 
the Village. 

Christina Kim is somewhere 
in the post-bac, pre-med, sugar- 
free program at Columbia. Troy 
Salsbury is about to begin a com¬ 
parative literature M.A. in Ohio. 

Meanwhile, back in Turkmen¬ 
istan, wrote Jennifer, she and 
Susarma are learning, among other 
things, how to cook borscht, eat 
sheep's head, and learn two lan¬ 
guages—Russian and Turkmen. 
They asked that people send let¬ 
ters or toilet paper, both of which I 
would happily forward from my 
address—^particularly with some 
news attached for me.

Have you ever noticed that when 
you're in a new place, you find 
yourself waiting impatiently for 
the mail every day? Sure, you're 
not really expecting anything, 
but who knows.. .today's clang 
of the mailbox could bring with 
it something unexpected, some¬ 
thing exciting: vivid descriptions 
of the glorious adventures of 
friends, acquaintances, or even 
strangers who are only familiar 
to you through a shared college 
experience. Or it could just bring 
the phone bill. I fear that the late 
publication of the last CCT has 
prevented many classmates from 
sharing with me the continuing 
stories of their post-Columbia 
College lives. But it's never too 
late: A quick note or e-mail mes¬ 
sage through the super informa¬ 
tion autobahn will do beautifully. 

So, greetings from Berlin. Life 
here has been frenzied but fulfill¬ 
ing. I've thus far survived the 
fifth anniversary of the fall of the 
Berlin Wall, university, ongoing 
work at the Associated Press, and 
minimal sunshine. The stagnancy 
of the dreary European weather 
is also getting to Ayanna Parish, 
in Sussex, England. So far her 
stay in England has made her 
aware of some of the peculiarities 
of the British. On the home front, 
however, happy congratulations 
and best wishes go to her and 
Derek Thompson, who have 
become engaged. Although they 
have only set a tentative wedding 
date for sometime after Derek is 
done with medical school at the 
University of Connecticut, 

Ayanna is very excited. She also 
tells me that on a recent trip to 
London, she ran into Imara Jones 
in a bar and says he seems to be 
enjoying experimenting with life 
in England. 

In other foreign news, Kay 
Bailey has packed her belongings 
and headed down to Mexico, and 
she writes that she is working at 


a trademark law firm and explor¬ 
ing her way through Mexico City 
by getting lost on various bus 
lines. Dy Tran is trapped in a 
sentimental novel in Tubingen, 
Germany, studying philosophy 
and practicing his German. I've 
also heard from Andrew Russo, 
who spent some time traveling 
through Malaysia and Singapore 
before heading to Taipei, Taiwan. 
At the university there he is con¬ 
tinuing his Mandarin studies, 
and he is also working for the 
weekend section of The China 
News and teaching English. Also, 
he is working with a production 
company and trying to develop a 
screenplay he wrote into a televi¬ 
sion series (unfortunately, he did¬ 
n't specify whether it was for 
U.S. or Taiwanese television). 

Through the infobahn I've been 
in touch with Josh Prager, who is 
on a Wallenberg Scholarship in 
Jerusalem and is currently an edi¬ 
torial assistant at The Jerusalem 
Report. He's living with Jeff 
Wechselblatt and Jonathan 
Konovitch, who writes that he is 
on a Fulbright Fellowship at the 
Hebrew University, researching 
the "impact of the Philistine 
expansion of power in the mid- 
11th century B.C.E. on the rise of 
the Israelite monarchy in Canaan." 
I hope he still has enough time to 
sing Sinatra in the shower. 

Here in Berlin I've run into 
Seema Balwani (who although 
she is graduating this year 
should technically be a member 
of our class). She tells me that 
Katy Terry is on her way to 
Russia to study, live, and work, 
and that Tani Meir is living and 
working in Israel. Seema also 
tells me that Lee Noriega is at 
the University of Toronto study¬ 
ing history and that Sanjiv 
Jhaveri is at the Academy of 
Dramatic Arts in New York. 

Many members of our class 
have stayed on in New York. 
Elizabeth Berke writes me that 
she loves her hectic job at the 
financial firm Sanford C. 
Bernstein, where she proofreads 
and helps edit all of their publi¬ 
cations (and gallivants around 
the plusher hotels in New York). 
Elizabeth also tells me that Elliot 
Regenstein is working at the 
Parks Commission in New York 
and he plans to build some sort 
of Parks Commission empire. 

Ben Strong has moved back to 
the city with decent bagels and is 
living in Brooklyn with Josh 
Shannon. He writes that he feels 
"toxic" because he is working for 
a consulting/research firm. He's 
also working (no doubt to clear 
his conscience and get free 
books) at Shakespeare & Co. 

Chris William writes that 
everything is going fine in the 
M.D./Ph.D. program at P&S, and 




tells me that Julie Losman is also 
in the program there. Mary 
Killackey is (almost) always 
studying, but loves medical life at 
P&S. She says that she often runs 
into Robert-Paul Sagner, who is 
working at an office job there. R-P 
tells me that Alex Rosenstein is 
working at the Museum of 
Televison and Radio and is apply¬ 
ing to law schools; Jon Katz is 
working at Dustin Hoffman's 
production company; Katy 
Negrin is working at the New 
School; Sofia Dumery and 
Lillian Koo are "making lots of 
money" working in investment 
banking; and Steve Ruddy is 
translating at Guantanamo Bay 
for a few months. Marina Curin 
is working as production man¬ 
ager for the J. Crew catalogue and 
plans to take the LSAT's in June. 
She writes me that she's sharing 
an apartment with Patty Ahn 
E'94 and Chris Parlamis, who is 
working in marketing at J. Crew. 

Mark Robilotti writes that he 
and Jay Berman are heavily 
immersed in their studies at 
Harvard (not so heavily 
immersed, apparently, since 
Mark has founded the "Bar 
Review," in which law students 
review local bars). Mark says that 
while they love Harvard, they 
miss New York and Columbia. 
Malancha Chanda writes that 
she's getting used to rural life in 
Lake Andes, S.D. She has been on 
a Yankton Sioux Reservation in 
the Women's Lodge/Shelter, 
working with women who have 
been victims of domestic vio¬ 
lence. She says it's difficult some¬ 
times, but it's been a learning 
experience. Danny Franklin, 
who is in Washington, D.C. 
working as an editor of The 
Washington Monthly, writes that 
he is "mourning the onset of a 
Republican-led Congress, and 
finds himself considering moving 
to Mali." While I understand his 
trauma. I'd like to point out that 
there probably isn't a Starbucks 
in Mali. 

And that's how the world 
looks for CC'94. Please write, and 
tell your friends to write. Send e- 
mail to me at: lkokmen@fub46.ze- 
dat.fu-berlin.de. Until next time.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR (CONT.)

Letters to the Editor 

(continued front page 5) 

Thomas Healy '37. His words evoked 
fond memories of his lectures, his wise 
counsel, his letters to me. Every day 1 
still find myself examining some state¬ 
ment in an attempt, as Casey would 
have me do, to determine what it really 
means. Imagine the fun Casey would 
have today with President Clinton or 
the balanced budget or Ted Kennedy or 
the welfare state. 

I still have my letters from him from 
1943 to 1969. The wartime ones were 
similar to Tom Healy's. He invokes 
Churchill, the Athenians, the positive 
impact of young American soldiers. He 
generously praises skills and talents. 
His "bless your heart" and "God bless 
you" are also used. 

There must be other Casey letters in 
alumni files. I hope they also write you 
and offer to send copies for publication 
in your magazine. Mine are certainly 
available. Let me know. The beautiful 
prose of this wonderful teacher should 
be available for all.

Fair and revealing 

As one of Professor Casey's students 
and admirers, I hasten to thank you 
for devoting some pages of CCT to the 
professor and Capt. Healy. It was such 
a fair and such a revealing article that it 
may well call attention at long last to 
Bill Casey and his teachings at Colum¬ 
bia. The book I published about 
"Caseyology" in 1987 fell on dull ears; 
it never even got reviewed at leading 
publications. Yet a few of Casey's old 
students are still following his words in 
action in medical ways, political and 
legal ways, and especially, in teaching 
and writing—only a few are left. Thank 
you for bringing Casey to your readers.

The writer is chairman of Sterling Pub¬ 
lishing Co. 

William Casey: Another view 
1 have thought about William F. Casey 
many times in the almost half century 
since I took his very popular sociology 
course. 1 was an immature and 
impressionable 19 at the time, but I 
grew up. Apparently, Casey never did. 

Happily, there is today not a solitary 
concept advanced by Professor Casey

that is recognized as valid. His entire 
philosophy is in total disgrace. 
Remember the "multiplier effect"? It 
was his mathematical justification for 
massive deficit spending by a massive 
central government. Big government, 
under the control of an elite, of course, 
was his answer to wealth creation. 
Labor unions had their role in keeping 
the evil capitalist entrepreneurs and 
spoilers in check. Nationalization of 
industry had its part to play. 

Had this been a course in economics, 
there would have been no hesitancy in 
applying the name "left-wing social¬ 
ism" or at least "left-wing democratic 
socialism" to the program. But Casey 
despised labels, and preferred to create 
a fog in an Ivory Tower—for impres¬ 
sionable me and an entire generation. I 
recall particularly his ridicule of a label 
of the time applied to the Soviet state in 
the late 1940's. Someone had called 
Stalin's regime "red fascism" and Pro¬ 
fessor Casey indignantly denounced 
not only evil p.r. image-makers, but a 
phobia of "seeing a communist under 
every bed." 

Upon my graduation from the 
College, I took a job as a junior purser 
on a ship chartered to the United 
Nations relief organization (UNRRA). 
We transported refugees and dis¬ 
placed persons from the camps of 
Germany to new homes in the USA 
and South America. A certain percent¬ 
age of the survivors were Jews, and I 
need hardly go into detail about what 
they had endured. But the vast majori¬ 
ty of passengers were Ukrainians, 


Russians, Balts, Poles—all with compa¬ 
rable tales of torture and extermination 
at the hands of the Soviet state. "Red 
fascism"? You bet. An appropriate 
phrase, actually. As was "evil empire" 
in its day (subsequently acknowledged 
by Russians in high positions as partic¬ 
ularly apt). 

It's unfair, of course, for me to blame 
poor William Casey for all of the naivete 
in economics, labor relations and politics 
of the post-World War II age. Still, his 
dream welfare state, Sweden, came close 
to bankruptcy and is stiU not entirely out 
of trouble. Elsewhere, de-nationalization 
or privatization of industry is the gospel 
world-wide—^to overcome the blunders 
of fifty years of policies of the left. 

Reading Casey's letter on the glories 
of building a massive army (and its com¬ 
mand structure of taking orders) indi¬ 
cates that he was never part of any such 
army himself. He apparently never expe¬ 
rienced anything like a real world or real 
challenge. Unfortunately, there wasn't 
even a CNN at the time to show him 
pictures of life outside the Ivory Tower. 

But he had books in his Tower. And 
one of his fields of interest was history, 
apparently. On the world stage, how 
come there was no knowledge of the 
massacre of the so-called kulaks? Or 
the Stalin purge trials of the late 1930's, 
or even Koestler's Darkness at Noon? 
One couldn't be so naive about Utopia, 
even when trying. And was Orwell's 
1984 just another corrupt distortion 
aimed at mass deception, such as the 
expression "red fascism"? It did upset 
the communists, of course. 


Professor Casey's letter of 1944 con¬ 
firms class struggle attitudes one would 
normally get from Karl Marx, i.e. "the 
same old generation of wreckers, mid¬ 
dle-aged and elderly, untouched by this 
war, except that it has made them 
unprecedentedly rich and arrogant... 
look forward to a return to the good old 
days when, with abounding unemploy¬ 
ment, they imagine they can break 
trade unions, reduce wages, lengthen 
working hours, and put what they 
regard as the 'lower classes' in their 
proper places again." If that's how he 
pictured business and industrial leaders 
he surely never met, we can at least be 
happy he wasn't chosen to draft 
appeals to the alumni for scholarship 
funds, or new buildings. Then again, 
assuming we are all damned for being 
above blue-collar status, why would a 
"generation of wreckers" respond to 
building an educational institution? 

Casey portrayed sociology as a 
mathematical, provable science—^which 
it isn't, and never can be. His amusing 
stories of Long Island commuters and 
others, his ability to portray himself as a 
lovable anti-establishment rebel plus his 
charm actually helped brainwash a gen¬ 
eration on vital domestic and interna¬ 
tional attitudes. With untold harm. 

Popular, fun, interesting, sure. 

"Most Valuable"? Nonsense!

The President's Box 

A great time to celebrate 
—and support—the College 

BY Martin S. Kaplan '61 

President, Columbia College Alumni Association 


W e have a great deal to celebrate this 
year! Everyone involved has the feel¬ 
ing that Columbia College is coming 
into its own, finally being recognized for the 
extraordinary undergraduate experience it 
offers. The evidence is all around us: 

1) Our signature academic program, the core 
curriculum, now celebrating its 75th year, contin¬ 
ues to adjust and mature with time, and receive 
the appropriate national recognition, with promi¬ 
nent coverage in The New York Times and The Wall 
Street Journal, for example. 

2) Student satisfaction surveys show Columbia undergrad¬ 
uates have a positive experience by overwhelming numbers, 
matching or exceeding our peer group. 

3) The College and University together are undertaking seri¬ 
ous reviews to strengthen the academic majors and the whole 
Upper College experience. 

4) Improving the quality of student services and campus 
life is now the focus of forceful and aggressive new measures 
on the part of the administration. 

5) The Class of '98 attracted a record number of applicants 
and markedly increased yield, with correlative gains in 
admissions selectivity and quality. 

6) The Class of 1994 set an enviable mark for its attainments 
in scholarships and fellowships, such as the Rhodes, Marshall 
and Mellon awards, and we expect great accomplishment 
from this year's seniors as well. 

7) President Rupp and the Board of Trustees have now firmly 
agreed to go forward with a new student activities center to 
replace Ferris Booth Hall, and to move forward as well on a new 
College Library and improvement in athletic and residential 
facilities. 

8) Finally, Columbia's winning football team brought a sense 
of renewed pride to the College and the alumni body. 

The College's position in the annual U.S. News & World 
Report survey has been rising, reflecting our outstanding stu¬ 
dent/teacher ratio, retention of students to graduation, 
admissions selectivity and other factors. One of the few soft 
spots is the relatively low percentage of alumni who regularly 
contribute to the College. We believe Columbia alumni are as 
enthusiastic as their peers at other Ivy institutions. We recog¬ 
nize, however, that many alumni attended Columbia when it 
was not the fully residential college it is today. Nevertheless, 
our surveys show as high a degree of satisfaction with the 
Columbia academic experience as at any other college in the 
country and an increasing national recognition of the out¬ 
standing experience available now to all our students. 

The increasing success and popularity of the College since it 
went coeducational has been remarkable. But that increases the 
College's need for our support in two key ways: 


1) With more applicants, we need more 
alumni interviewers. And, with more secondary 
schools and their students interested in 
Columbia, we need more alumni reaching out 
to those schools and recruiting top students. 

2) We need the support of a far greater per¬ 
centage of alumni in the Columbia College Fund 
in order to preserve need-blind admissions and 
full-need financial aid and enhance the quality 
of our teaching. Last year 2,000 alumni con¬ 
tributed at the John Jay level, $1000 or more per 

year. We need many more alumni and parents at that level. 
Even if you cannot afford to give at the John Jay level, any 
amount helps! 

The Alumni Association has organized eight major commit¬ 
tees to encourage and support the implementation of the 1993 
Report on the Future of Columbia College. They are each chaired 
by outstanding alumni. The committees and chairmen are: 

• Columbia College Fund: Phillip M. Satow '63 

• Admissions and Financial Aid: Bruce E. Pindyck '67 

• Campus Facilities: Robert A. M. Stern '60 

• Student Affairs: Arthur B. Spector '68 

• Public Relations: Lee J. Guittar '53 

• Academic Affairs: Charles O'Byrne '81 

• Athletics: Gerald Sherwin '55 

• University Affairs: Brian C. Krisberg '81 

They will be working over the next two years, preparing and 
publishing reports as needed. If you wish to participate in this 
effort, please contact me c/o Office of Alumni Affairs and Devel¬ 
opment, 475 Riverside Drive, Suite 917, New York, N.Y. 10115. 

In addition, the Alumni Association is working with both 
the College and the University alumni offices to strengthen 
all aspects of alumni relatipns, including fundraising, so we 
can achieve the construction of the new Ferris Booth Hall, 
College Library, and fulfill our other essential needs. Both of 
those offices are improving and upgrading their operations 
to support this critical effort. 

The Report on the Future of Columbia College set as our goal: "For 
the College to be, and to be recognized as, the preeminent under¬ 
graduate college within any major university by the year 2000." 
We believe this is an attainable goal and reflects not only Colum¬ 
bia's strengths but the uniqueness and increasing popularity of 
New York City as a place for students to live, learn and grow. 

As we will be reporting to you soon in a special publication, 
the celebration of Columbia's 75th anniversary of the core cur¬ 
riculum began with a tremendously successful Hamilton Dinner 
attended by over 600, honoring the tenured teachers of the core. 
The year-long events continue with Dean's Day on Saturday, 
April 8, which will be dedicated to various aspects of the core . 

Meanwhile, we urge you to support the Columbia College 
Fund and the efforts to extend our winning record!

Columbia College Today 


The Lion^s Den 

As long as I keep on this earth 

W/zy memory is the highest of honors. 

BY Jack Arbolino '42 


Editor's Note: Jack Arbolino served from 1942 to 1946 in the U.S. 
Marine Corps, was wounded at Saipan, and retired with the rank of 
major in the reserves. While overseas he sometimes wrote Professor 
Mark Van Doren, who recalled in his autobiography, "Jack Arbolino, 
soft-eyed and affectionate, was no less impossible to imagine as a 
marine in the Pacific; his letters were not about that at all, except to be 
sure when he was wounded; then, lying in a hospital, he wrote me 
about the happiness it gave him to lie here and think of all my friends 
who are dead'—really think of them, night and day, as they deserved." 

Some 50 years later, as the nation prepares to commemorate the 
climactic events of World War II, we asked Mr. Arbolino to share 
some personal reflections on the war and the Columbia College men 
who served. 

B ernie Ireland '31, who admitted the classes that went 
from the College into World War II, thought the last 
sentence of Thornton Wilder's The Bridge of San Luis 
Rey was the truest, richest one he had ever read: "There is a 
land of the living and a land of the dead, and the bridge is 
love, the only survival, the only meaning." 

Fifty-one years ago, during my wartime service, I wrote as 
much to my great teacher Mark Van Doren, telling him how 
much good it did me to think at length about my dead friends. 
Mark told me when I returned to work at Columbia after the 
war that although he understood what I meant, certain of his 
colleagues thought my feelings strange. It was not until I read 
his wonderful poem, "The Uncle I 
Was Named For," that I was able to 
appreciate one of his "strange" 
thoughts: 

The uncle I was named for 
Is not there now, four muddy miles 
Northwest of Wapanucka, 

Oklahoma.... 

He's not there now, or anywhere; 

Nor has to be, as long as I 
Keep on this earth 
And can remember. 

P hil Bayer '42 was my friend. 

We were football teammates as 
well. In the summer of 1941, 
that last perfect summer, we worked 
together, along with another class¬ 
mate and tearmnate, Ray Makofske, 
at Manhattan Beach as special guards. 

Phil and I shared a small room in a 
boarding house near Lundy's Restau¬ 
rant on Sheepshead Bay. Our job was 
to patrol the grounds—the pool areas, 
the handball and shuffle board 
courts, and the bandstand. 

One day Phil and I had to go into 
the large open ladies' dressing area 
with a stretcher to carry out a 


woman who had grown faint. It was a fine job for young men 
in summer. 

Phil served on Guadalcanal, was wounded at Cape 
Gloucester, and played a leading role in the capture of Target 
Hill in the New Britain campaign. He was killed in action on 
September 18,1944, on the island of Pelelieu, in one of the 
Marine Corps' bloodiest battles. Although he was hurt severely 
enough to be taken out, he continued to lead his platoon until 
he was wounded again, this time mortally. He was awarded a 
Silver Star and other citations for bravery and devotion to duty 
in combat. 

C arved on the walls of the foyer in Princeton Univer¬ 
sity's Nassau Hall are the names of alumni who died 
in the service of their country. At Harvard, two 
buildings—Memorial Church and Memorial Hall—^bear the 
names of that school's war dead. 

There is no comparable recognition at Columbia Univer¬ 
sity for the many men and women who have served and fall¬ 
en for their country. 

There is, however, a small, pretty park in Flushing, New 
York, named in Phil's honor, as well as a trophy case in 
Levien Gym bearing a plaque with this passage from Antony 
and Cleopatra: "He wears the rose of youth upon him/From 
which the world should note something particular." One of 
the 52 donors of that case, our classmate Gerald Green, dedi¬ 
cated his novel. East and West, "to 
the memory of Philip Bayer, First 
Lieutenant, United States Marine 
Corps Reserve." The latest tribute to 
Phil appeared in seven Long Island 
newspapers on November 10, 

1994—a fine full-page piece for 
Armistice Day, "A Hero Remem¬ 
bered," written by another one of 
his friends, Joan Brown Wettingfeld, 
Barnard '42. 

Perhaps we should acknowledge 
the many other College men who 
fought in World War II. Some, like 
Phil, were gallant and are not here 
now. But as long as we can remem¬ 
ber, we can, at least, think of them 
as they deserve. For ourselves, we 
can be thankful for the bridges 
between us and the precious, unfor¬ 
gettable past we shared. q 

Jack Arbolino '42 spent 12 years as a 
teacher and administrator at Columbia 
and later served three decades with The 
College Board. He is the father of Philip 
Bayer Arbolino '68 and the grandfather 
of Jonathan James Arbolino '93. 



Pacific bound: On March 31, 1942—the day they enlist¬ 
ed in the Marine Corps—classmates Jack Arbolino, Don 
Seligman, Paul Moriarty, and Phil Bayer posed in front 
of Alma Mater. All served as officers; Bayer was killed in 
action, Arbolino and Moriarty were wounded on Saipan 
on the same day, and Seligman saw combat at Pelelieu.

Columbia College Today 


Within the Family 


Tradition and renewal 


// 


Ti 


raditions don't just exist 
by being repeated," said 
Austin Quigley, "they 
exist by being constantly renewed." 

Professor Quigley, appointed in 
May as Dean of Columbia College 
(page 6), has been summoned to lead 
the nation's fifth oldest college, and 
history is much on his mind. 

In his first conversations with CCT, 
he made clear that he is committed to 
the momentum of development the 
College has recently enjoyed, upgrad¬ 
ing student services and campus facili¬ 
ties, among other initiatives. Yet Dean 
Quigley is also well aware of what for¬ 
mer Dean of Students Henry S. Cole¬ 
man '46 once termed "the College's his¬ 
toric demand for identity 
within the University." 

"1 don't see enough 
manifestations of the his¬ 
tory of the College, the 
pride the College takes 
in the achievements of 
its students and in the 
distinguished faculty 
who've been through 
here," Mr. Quigley 
remarked. "1 think if you 
have that history much more clearly 
visible and up front in the minds of 
everyone who's here, you don't have 
to start reminding people that the Col¬ 
lege exists as an historical enterprise 
rather than just the sum of a couple of 
buildings and their occupants." 

As Hamilton Hall welcomes its 
14th dean, there is a certain pleasure, 
too, in the restoration of the office as 
distinct from the vice presidency of 
Arts and Sciences. The two-year 
experiment in fusing those roles did 
yield certain benefits, but also took 
its toll on the incumbent, Steven 
Marcus '48. An influential teacher 
and renowned literary scholar. Pro¬ 
fessor Marcus now returns to an 
honored position on the faculty. 

T here is a curious Columbia 
tendency "to cherish certain 
traditions and want to smash 
them at the same time," Rebecca 
Turner '87 affirms in her lead story 
on the campus music scene (page 10). 



These pages have been so given over 
to Columbia anniversaries—Mark 
Van Doren, the Varsity Show, and in 
this issue, the Manhattan Project 
(page 18) —that Ms. Turner's report 
gives a needed jolt of the T in CCT. 

Of course, the sirens of yesterday 
sing to us as well. In my era, the Soul 
Syndicate was probably the hippest 
band at Columbia. "We were half 
black, half white, and damned good," 
remembers lead singer Khalid Rashid 
(formerly Kent Parker) '69. "Music 
carried the philosophy of the day." 

Later on it was bands like So What, 
the Ex-Husbands, the Art of Dating, 

Sick Dick and Zie Volkswagens, and 
the Casuals. While the Spin Doctors 

gigged on fraternity row 
and the Red Hot Chili 
Peppers played WoU- 
man, Columbia's own 
Two Skinny J's were on 
the Dick Clark show and 
at CBGB's. 'They were a 
brilliant band—sort of 
rap/funk," says Liz 
Pleshette '89, "and they 
had a major cult follow¬ 
ing on campus." 

W ith this issue, we welcome 
three new members to the 
CCT Alumni Advisory 
Board: Elena Cabral '93, a staff writer 
for the Ford Foundation and regular 
contributor to these pages; Duchesne 
Paul Drew '89, a reporter for the 
Minneapolis Star Tribune; and Paul A. 
Argenti '75, adjunct professor of 
management communication at Dart¬ 
mouth, editor of The Portable MBA, 
and newly appointed v.p. for public 
relations of the College Alumni Asso¬ 
ciation. (His moving Lion's Den col¬ 
umn appears on page 48.) 

While our expert advisory board 
helps us re-evaluate the College's 
alumni communications strategy, we 
encourage CCT's amazingly loyal 
readers to join in this critical discus¬ 
sion by mail, or now, by e-mail.

Tribute to Marcus 

Your Winter 1995 issue focused on 
Mark Van Doren, long recognized as 
one of the College's great teachers. 

The tribute reminded me of another 
great teacher, Steven Marcus '48, who 
was honored by the Alumni Associa¬ 
tion at a luncheon on May 12 upon his 
retirement as Dean of the College and 
Vice President for Arts and Sciences. A 
classmate attended the event with me 
because Professor Marcus had made 
such a strong impression as our Eng¬ 
lish instructor 34 years earlier. 

Your Fall 1993 issue described Pro¬ 
fessor Marcus as "a man of sufficient 
gravitas," emphasizing his scholarly 
credentials and the respect of his 
peers. To a 17-year-old freshman in the 
fall of 1961, Mr. Marcus was a com¬ 
manding presence. He prodded the 
class intensely, forcing us to read 
closely, think clearly, and write con¬ 
cretely. 1 wished at the time that the 
experience would be easy. It was not. 

In the very first class hour, he asked 
us to defend an unpopular opinion, 
gave us writing booklets and then left 
the room. We quickly learned, when 
we saw his comments and heard him 
speak, that we would not be drifting 
through this course. He deftly guided 
us over our first semester through 
memorably vigorous readings of 
Orwell, Swift, Dostoyevsky, Donne 
and Marvell. 

The experience did not end in the 
classroom. Mr. Marcus always 
returned our papers promptly, saying 
more in the margins than anything we 
had originally tried to say in 500 
words of text. He frequently invited 
me to his office for additional teach¬ 
ing, not social chatter. He even dis¬ 
cussed some of the readings in my 
other courses, something I thought 
was exceptional for an English teacher. 
I did not fully appreciate his power at 
the time, but I do so now. Steven Mar¬ 
cus opened up the world of lifelong 
learning to my classmates and me, a 
rewarding and wonderful gift. 

Professor Marcus is a very special 
and a very committed teacher. The 
College owes this gifted man a great 
deal. He has had many exceedingly 
satisfied customers.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 


Van Doren's best shot 

For no less than 60 years I have been 
telling anyone who would listen what 
an inspiring teacher and admirable 
human being Mark Van Doren was. I 
was therefore delighted by your Win¬ 
ter 1995 issue. 1 took all of the courses 
that Van Doren taught in the College 
and kept in touch with him while 
working on my Ph.D., so that when I 
came up for the "defense" of my dis¬ 
sertation (devoted, under his inspira¬ 
tion, to John Donne), he accompanied 
me to the room where I was to face 
my examiners. 

It was he, too, who recommended 
me to Irita Van Doren, editor of the 
books section of The New York Herald 
Tribune, which led to my doing several 
hundred reviews for that paper and, 
in time, to my becoming an editor and 
author. 

An example of his humor and class¬ 
room informality: I remember the 
occasion when, as he was raising his 
hand while referring to "the shot 
heard 'round the world," a shot rang 
out on the street below. Without paus¬ 
ing, he raised his hand once more and 
said, "Let's see if I can do it again."

The kindness of teachers 

Thank you for the delightful nostalgia of 
Mark Van Doren and his times. When I 
applied for a Rhodes scholarship, he 
wrote a gracious letter of recommenda¬ 
tion which 1 stiU keep (I was politically 
and religiously incorrect at the Rhodes 
interview and didn't get the scholarship). 



Van Doren issue: 

The mailbag overflowed 


Professor Van Doren was also kind 
enough, when I selectively inattended 
one out of three questions in the final 
examination of his "Verse" class, to 
attribute my lapse to anxiety and give 
me a B-h. 

Mark Van Doren could be idealized, 
yet humor seemed to make him uncom¬ 
fortable and distant. Moses Hadas, on 
the other hand, had more of a sense of 
equality and loving banter. How about 
an article on Professor Hadas?

Valuable career advice 

I was delighted to find that CCT's 
Winter 1995 issue was devoted to 
Mark Van Doren. 1 was very fond of 
Mark; he was very kind to me and a 
dedicated friend. At one time I aspired 
to graduate work in literature in the 
hope that I might teach in the English 
department at Columbia or at some 
other university. Mark advised me not 
to do so, telling me that while it was 
possible for a Jew to teach philosophy, 
economics or science, English was a 
prohibited area. How things have 
changed! I had no interest or ambition 
in becoming a lawyer, but I entered 
the Law School for want of any other 
alternative. I have always been 
indebted to Mark for his advice, 
because instead of my entering a blind 
alley, I found that law was really my 
field. I've had a wonderful life teach¬ 
ing and practicing my profession. 

Milton Handler '24

From jock to grind 

Kudos for a superb Winter '95 issue 
featuring Professor Van Doren in 
remembrance. I related especially to 
reading that Van Doren's "teaching 
and his spirit stretched the minds of 
athletes, engineers," etc., for I was 
converted from a "jock" to a reason¬ 
ably serious student primarily because 
of his class on "The Narrative Art." 

Having taken a keen interest in the 
class readings, and having worked late 
on the inevitable papers after basket¬ 
ball practice and/or a meal job, I was 
dismayed to receive only C's, maybe a 
C+ (Van Doren wasn't known for low 
grades). So I stopped him between 
classes in front of Hamilton Hall and 
asked why I couldn't seem to do better, 
as I was putting forth a serious effort. 
Without hesitating one second, he said, 
"How long have you been playing

basketball, Mr. Powers?" Touche. 

I persisted and managed to elevate 
to B's and B-'s, later offering up a 
paper on "The Emotional Impact of 
Homer." I thought it my masterpiece, 
but Professor Van Doren wrote on it, 

"I can't criticize this, B-". So I took it 
to him and asked, "Sir, if you can't 
criticize this, doesn't it deserve a better 
grade?" He said, "You're right, Mr. 
Powers," and slashed a vertical line 
through the horizontal one, giving me 
my first B-i- in his class. Touche again. 

Along with the 45 volumes from the 
Classic Book Club that I accrued dur¬ 
ing my years in the U.S. Air Force 
(and which accompanied me to mili¬ 
tary stations in the U.S., Okinawa, 
Japan and England), the books from 
Professor Van Doren's class and 
Humanities now form the "core" of 
my library. I played a lot of basketball 
in the service, but thanks to Mark Van 
Doren and Columbia, I also read a lot. 
And now, recently retired, I can visit

"only" or "always"!

Rampant smugness 

Reading the accounts of Columbia's 
celebration of 75 years of the core cur¬ 
riculum fills me with despair. It is no 
surprise, perhaps, that old, white, rich, 
powerful men take pleasure in gather¬ 
ing in their tuxes in New York to con¬ 
gratulate themselves on having had a 
better education than anyone else in 
the world. 

It is also, perhaps, no surprise that 
the tired old intellectuals of the 1950's 
and 1960's like to harken back to the 
halcyon days when the canon was the 
canon, and women and blacks were 
properly appreciative of the marginal 
positions afforded them by Columbia. 
Nevertheless, it is depressing to read 
the vituperative attacks launched by 
once liberal thinkers on those who 
have a broader view of intellectual life 
in the 1990's. 

The celebrants of the core curricu¬ 
lum just don't get it: what made those 
courses wonderful was a process, the 
process of engaging ideas and con¬ 
ducting intelligent discourse in small 
groups led by great teachers. The par¬ 
ticular books we read were not so 
important as how we read them. The 
ideas that students need to engage— 
the universalities of the human condi¬ 
tion—do not reside exclusively in 
Aeschylus or Maimonides or Marx. 
They also live in Jane Austen and the 
Koran and Lao Tze and Du Bois. To 
deny our common humanity with the 
great writers of the non-European 
world is to adopt a crabbed cultural 
provincialism that has long since lost 
its relevance. 

It is one thing for faculty old-timers 
to harbor a nostalgia for a bygone era 
when European thought was the only 
game in town. It is downright mean- 
spirited when they ridicule as trendy 
and inconsequential the literature, phi¬ 
losophy, politics and art of nine-tenths 
of the world. Jacques Barzun '27 
damns as "blasphemous" a campus 


"To deny our common 
humanity with the 
great writers of the 
non-European world is 
to adopt a crabbed 
cultural provincialism 
that has long since 
lost its relevance," 

—Francis W. Hoeber '65 


environment that suggests there is 
more to intellectual life than the hand¬ 
ful of works he and his kind chris¬ 
tened "classics" some 75 years ago, 
and the powerful men of America's 
corporate establishment, who still run 
Columbia, cheer him on. 

If the little circle of smart folks who 
make up Columbia University is so nar¬ 
row-minded, bigoted and smug, what 
hope is there for the rest of America?

Memories of Phil 

I could not put aside the very moving 
reflections of Jack Arbolino '42 and his 
tribute to his classmate Phil Bayer ["As 
Long As I Keep on This Earth," Lion's 
Den, Spring 1995] without writing. 

I have a faint recollection of Phil—he 
was a senior when I was a freshman— 
but I believe I remember him as a light- 
footed halfback who was assigned the 
role of running a naked reverse, similar 
to KF-79, usually getting creamed by a 
gigantic left end but often enough 
breaking loose to justify trying again. 
Jack's reminiscence is surely correct 
that memory of our departed friends is 
important—even, I guess, if it is not 
wholly accurate, so I pass it on. 

I wonder if anyone will pick up on 
the suggestion that the University 
memorialize its war dead? 

Edward N. Costikyan '47

Lack of remembrance 

I attended Columbia in 1942 until the Air 
Force (Army) finally took me. As I 
remember, there was a paucity of "war 
stories," or even of personal reflections, 
among the veterans who returned to 
campus. Perhaps we were too consumed 
with the miraculously wonderful hap¬ 


penstance of (subconsciously recognized) 
survival. Nor, as Jack Arbolino's most 
meaningful "Lion's Den" pointed out, do 
I recall any formal recognition of college- 
mates who were not fortunate enough to 
return to Morningside Heights. 

But the article brought forth poignant 
recall. Perhaps the piece moved me so 
as a function of age—not really the 
depression commonly indigenous to 
those of us entering our eighth decade 
but rather a sorrowful feeling for those 
who cannot feel the great pride of hav¬ 
ing, as Jack does, a son and a grandson 
graduate from Columbia. That is really 
"smelling the roses"! 

Jack, you're right! We do need, and 
there should be, some sort of recogni¬ 
tion—and not just for World War 11. 
Thank you for a thoughtful and gra¬ 
cious tribute. 

Walter S. Wood '47, M.D. 

HINSDALE, ILL. 

(Addendum: I was in the 13th Army 
Air Force, and we landed our B-24 on 
Pelelieu, where Phil Bayer died, early 
in '45.1 never saw, nor could believe, 
such total destruction—not a coconut 
or palm tree standing!) 

Crossed paths 

Congratulations on Jack Arbolino's 
"Lion's Den" about Phil Bayer. I was 
very much moved by Jack's remark in 
his letter to Mark Van Doren to the 
effect that when he was lying in the 
hospital wounded, it gave him happi¬ 
ness to really think of all his friends 
who were dead—night and day, as 
they deserved. That's pretty deep and 
sensitive stuff. 

The article rekindled a memory of a 
time I ran into our classmate Paul 
Moriarty on Saipan. I found him slog¬ 
ging along on a dirt road while I was 
sightseeing in a jeep. I was a Navy fly- 
boy as they called us, piloting PBM 
seaplanes out of Saipan harbor. I got 
Paul out to our ship in the harbor, 
treated him to a hot shower and feted 
him in the ward room with a steak 
dinner served on white linen with 
gleaming silver. Having been on K 
rations, Paul just about went bonkers!

Van Doren brought insights and appre¬ 
ciation to the reading of Shakespeare 
which enrich my life to this day. Tak¬ 
ing his course as a sophomore was a 
treasured privilege. 

And then in junior year I was lucky 
enough to have him as one of two 
teachers in the Colloquium on Great 
Books. Moses Hadas, no less an idol, 
was the other: the elegant patrician 
aesthete, side by side with the city- 
bred former rabbi and now renowned 
classicist. A superb combination: they 
were brilliant yet relaxed, they seemed 
to love what they were doing, and 
they respected and enjoyed each other. 
Those were treasured sessions. The 
erudition was that thick, but there was 
lots of humor as well—sophisticated 
and genteel from Van Doren, earthy 
and sometimes ribald from Hadas. 
What a team! Where else could eight 
or ten undergraduates meet with two 
of the highest-level academic luminar¬ 
ies under those circumstances? Such 
opportunities illustrate graphically the 
unique excellence of the Columbia 
College experience. 

Your magazine offers great pleasure, 
bringing me up to date on Columbia 
events and reminding me of some of 
the happiest days of my life. This was 
particularly true of the Varsity Show 
issue [Fall 1994], recalling as it did my 
debut and short career as a thespian. 

Crossing campus after the usual 55- 
cent [sic!] dinner, 1 mentioned to my 
cherished and still closely associated 
classmate, A1 Lukashok, a Spectator 
announcement of casting for Saints 
Alive, the 1942 show. There was a par¬ 
ticular role that sounded like fun and 
so, as a lark, we became Abercrombie 
Strongheart, "The Horse Who Could 
Conga." Encased in a cloth horse cos¬ 
tume, we pranced and danced the 
appropriate Latin steps to our lively 
signature song. References to me as a 
horse's neck were inevitable, quite lit¬ 
eral, and, under the circumstances, 
accepted without umbrage. Of course, 
my posterior partner was the recipient 
of even less flattering (and occasion¬ 
ally scatalogical) appellations. We 
have remained inseparable ever since. 

Whether we or the pony ballet drew 
the loudest applause shall remain for¬ 
ever uncertain. We did have lots of fun. 

Thank you for the great effort that 
goes into creating a splendid publication.

Varsity Show: The dark side 

Your Varsity Show piece really warmed 
me. I auditioned for Saints Alive in 1942 
but was consigned to join some CURC 
colleagues in building the scenery (for 
$.50 an hour, which was okay). 1 crewed, 
too, for the same amount, and went to 
the post-show dance, without a ticket, in 
my work clothes, to smooch with my 
girl. She went with George Stecher '42 
(he played the female lead, a Barnard 
Bulletin reporter wearing a large "Press" 
button you know where), a friend who 
took her to places 1 couldn't afford. 

1 remember a blackout scene in 
which Gerry Green '42 was to dash 
upstage and appear miraculously else¬ 
where when the lights came on. Jimmy 
Sondheim '42, an otherwise decent, 
sane fellow, was on lights, and for 
some reason he enjoyed switching 
other lights on, as if by accident, to 
reveal Gerry on the sneak. (I'm a for¬ 
mer drama professor and would as 
soon assault anyone who did that to 
anyone. I've actually kicked kids out of 
school for less.) Sondheim kept pulling 
this stupid trick, so when it came time 
for us to play the Astor, director Paul 
Winkopp '25 arranged to come into the 
booth himself and work those cues. 

Sondheim, however, and the CURC 
technicians (remarkable guys, actually; 
that station was truly pioneering) ran 
wires to a corner of the stage where 
they gleefully fouled up the scene for 
the final time. 1 recall Winkopp giving 
me a sad look as he left the booth. 

The pony ballet included our

remaining great jocks, whom I knew 
thanks to my classmate Walter Wager, 
their dorm mascot. They rehearsed 
most earnestly and got the simple 
dance routines down surprisingly well. 
Then, of course, they got drunk on the 
opening and subsequent nights and 
fell all over themselves. 1 recall five or 
six of them slumped against the wall 
of an adjacent hallway during inter¬ 
mission, ministered to by despairing 
stage managers. I assume Winkopp 
was used to and ready for that. 

The cover by Ad Reinhardt '35 was a 
gem. He did some lovely work for Jester, 
worth reprinting indeed. Worth collecting!

Family drama 

Thank you so much for the delightful 
history of the Varsity Show, which 
became so much a part of our own 
family history. My mother. Sue Slough 
Pratt TC'36, was remembered in your 
article as the show's first-ever female 
lead, in the 1936 production of Off 
Your Marx. We grew up delighting in 
her stories of the show and her years 
at Columbia. She, her brother. Major 
Carl Slough '38, and her sister, Betty 
Jane Slough McCollum TC'35, all 
attended Columbia after starting col¬ 
lege at the University of Cincinnati. 

It may interest you to know that 
mother married Everard S. ('Tote") Pratt 
'38, who wrote the song'T Walk Asleep in 
a Dream" for Off Your Marx. They did not 
meet, however, during the production, but 
were introduced later by my uncle Carl. 

Mother and Dad continued to share 
their musical and artistic talent after 
they left the stage. Mother became a 
clothing designer; Dad designed 
church pipe organs and later led the 
dismantling and rebuilding of a mighty 
Wurlitzer that is now in use at the 
Emory Theater in Cincinnati.

As a former member of the pony ballet, I 
enjoyed your issue on the Varsity Show. 

As a result of my appearance in either Fair 
Enough in '39 or in Life Begins in '40, 1 was

is a picture of me with a classmate dressed 
as a detective peering up my skirts.

M ore than a year after Dean Steven Marcus '48 
declared his intention to step down from the 
administration for health reasons, the Col¬ 
lege's new dramatis personae have made their 
entrance. 

On May 17, the University announced that Austin E. Quigley, 
a member of the Columbia English department since 1990, 
would take over on July 1 as Dean of the College. His selection 
followed by six weeks the appointment of Northwestern Univer¬ 
sity provost David H. Cohen as the new Vice President for Arts 
and Sciences, the other role played since 1993 by Professor Mar¬ 
cus, who now returns to teaching and writing. 

Dean Quigley, 52 years old, is an authority on modern drama 
who has headed the University's expanding programs in theater 
arts. His scholarship has concentrated on 19th- and 20th-century 
European playwrights such as Ibsen, Strindberg, Wilde, Brecht, 
Genet, Ionesco and Pinter, as well as literary and linguistic the¬ 
ory and the philosophy of language. The first English subject to 
occupy the deanship since Peter R. Pouncey in the 1970's, Mr. 
Quigley was chairman of the English department at the Univer¬ 
sity of Virginia before coming to Columbia. 

In a statement accompanying the May announcement, Mr. 
Quigley said he was honored to have been chosen to lead the 
school at a crucial time for undergraduate education. 

"A persistent sense of generational responsibility links past, 
present and future members of the College, and we who are here 
now have our brief opportunity to draw the maps and chart the 
route," he said. "In a period of social flux and institutional 
renewal, our aim is not to plot the destination of every student 
but to teach them how to travel with purpose, understanding 
and control." 

In an interview, Mr. Quigley spoke of the "remarkable una¬ 
nimity" he found among University leaders on the importance 
of upgrading the College's offerings. "It's clear that the upper 
levels of the administration, including the President, the Provost, 
and the Vice President, are very, very serious about doing some¬ 
thing significantly new for undergraduate education," he said. 

His top priorities as dean will include maintaining the Col¬ 
lege's commitment to student financial aid, rebuilding the stu¬ 
dent center and College Library, and providing new dormitory 
and recreational facilities. "Before I start making policy decisions 
or dictating priorities," he cautioned, "it seems to me that I need 
to listen a lot to the students, the faculty, the alumni and the 
administrative staff." 

The author of The Modern Stage and Other Worlds (1985), The 
Pinter Problem (1975) and the recently completed Theoretical 
Inquiry: Language, Linguistics and Literary Studies, among other 
works, Mr. Quigley holds Columbia's H. Gordon Garbedian pro¬ 
fessorship. As dean, he will also hold the title of Associate Vice 
President for Undergraduate Education, reporting to Vice Presi¬ 
dent Cohen. 

Dr. Cohen, a neurobiologist, played a major role in the 
appointment of Professor Quigley, who was one of three candi¬ 
dates recommended by a dean's search committee chaired by 
David Rosand '58, the Meyer Schapiro Professor of Art History. 


Both Dr. Cohen and Professor Rosand emphasized the impor¬ 
tance of maintaining balance within the Arts and Sciences leader¬ 
ship—not only between undergraduate and graduate education, 
but among the sciences, the social sciences, and the humanities. 

Reaction to Dean Quigley's appointment was enthusiastic. 

"You want someone who can speak with confidence and rhet¬ 
orical purpose about the College," Professor Rosand said. "He 
projected both a kind of administrative savvy and an intellectual 
commitment that were really impressive." Psychology professor 
Donald C. Hood, a former Vice President for Arts and Sciences, 
added, "He's got good values, he's got good instincts, and he's 
the real thing in terms of being both a scholar and a teacher." 

The author and critic Patricia Meyer Spacks, until recently 
president of the Modern Language Association, chairs the Eng¬ 
lish department at Virginia, where she was recruited from Yale 
in 1989 by Mr. Quigley. "I admire his administrative talents 
tremendously," she said. "He is straightforward in his presenta¬ 
tion of facts, and ingenious in his calculation of effects." 

"He's very eloquent and very personable," said Janet 
Frankston '95, a student member of the search committee. "He 
seems not afraid to fight for what he believes in, which is very 
important for a College Dean. And he has a great British accent." 

I ndeed, "this odd sound," as Dean Quigley refers to his 
speech, bears the marks of his life's journey, from the deep 
vowels of his native Northumberland to the elements of pac¬ 
ing and diction acquired during a 25-year academic career in the 
United States. 

Austin Edmund Quigley, one of five children, was born 
December 31,1942, in the far northeast of England, an area long 
contested by the English and Scots and "full of ruined castles, 
ancient battlefields, and a very, very deep sense of the people 
who lived here before," he said. 

Mr. Quigley's parents both taught school in the village of 
Annitsford, and he grew up in Felling, County Durham. "My 
father was the headmaster of the village school and was quite 
remarkable with young children. He had a remarkably formed 
sense of community—how to bring children together and remind 
them of the history of the world in which they were growing up." 
Mr. Quigley's father was captured by the Germans as a prisoner 
of war during the ill-fated British glider raid on Arnhem in 1944. 

For years, England seemed "a country that was in many ways 
exhausted, beat up, tired," Mr. Quigley said. Food was scarce, 
and rationing would continue until the 1950's. "One of my earli¬ 
est memories is receiving boxes of fruit from New Zealand and 
Australia, sent to the children in England after the war," he said. 
Another hardship came when his father died in 1960, and he 
was obliged to shoulder larger family responsibilities. His gener¬ 
ation grew up, he believes, "with a certain tenacity that comes 
with feeling that you have to do what you have to do in life, and 
you can't be dissuaded by the fact that things seem difficult or 
even close to impossible." 

An outstanding soccer player, Mr. Quigley starred at center 
forward for the junior team of Newcastle United, one of Eng¬ 
land's premier clubs, and then at Nottingham University, where 
he earned his B.A. in 1967. After receiving a master's degree in

modern linguistics at Birming¬ 
ham University in 1969, he 
came to the U.S. to pursue doc¬ 
toral work in literary studies at 
the University of California's 
idyllic Santa Cruz campus. His 
1971 Ph.D. dissertation on Pin¬ 
ter formed the basis of his later 
book. 

After teaching at the Univer¬ 
sity of Massachusetts at Amherst 
for two years, he joined the fac¬ 
ulty at Virginia, where he helped 
create an interdisciplinary 
undergraduate program in mod¬ 
em studies. He has held visiting 
appointments in England, Ger¬ 
many and Switzerland. 

In five years at Columbia, he 
has helped establish the 
Columbia/Barnard undergrad¬ 
uate major in drama and the¬ 
ater arts and rebuild the gradu¬ 
ate programs. Since 1992 he has 
been Associate Director of the 


Oscar Hammerstein II Center 
for Theater Studies, and since 
1993 has chaired the presti¬ 
gious Lionel Trilling Seminars. 

An enthusiast of tennis and 
hiking—especially in the Eng¬ 
lish Lake District immortalized 
by Wordsworth and other 
poets—Dean Quigley is mar¬ 
ried to Patricia D. Denison, a 
lecturer in English at Barnard. 
They have four daughters, Car¬ 
oline, Catherine, Laura and 
Rebecca, and live near the cam¬ 
pus on Riverside Drive. 

Mr. Quigley looks forward to 
his deanship with optimism— 
not that there won't be "prob¬ 
lems, difficulties, intractable 
things that can't get fixed, or 
are going to get fixed more 
slowly than you would wish," 
he said. 

"But I relish it primarily 
because this is just a very fortu¬ 


nate thing for me to have been 
allowed to take on," he added. 
"I have an enormous respect 
for the College—I already take 
tremendous pride in it—and 
I'm very lucky that my dean- 
ship should have coincided 
with a moment when there are 
new opportunities for us to 
improve what we do in per¬ 
haps very significant ways, and 
new possibilities for building 
relationships between the Col¬ 
lege and the rest of the Univer¬ 
sity that will have been for the 
good of everybody concerned."

■ Even hotter: Applications 
for admission to Columbia Col¬ 
lege have now increased by 29 
percent over the past two years, 
the largest such gain in the Ivies, 


reports Dean of Undergraduate 
Admissions Drusilla Blackman. 
The incoming Class of 1999 is 
"the most selective" in the his¬ 
tory of the College, she says. 

Exactly 8,712 candidates 
applied this year, and 1,974— 
just 23 percent—received offers 
of admission. Median combined 
SAT scores for the admitted 
group jumped to 1340 from last 
year's figure of 1315, and 92 
percent of the students admit¬ 
ted this year ranked in the top 
decile of their high school class, 
compared with 76 percent a 
year ago. Once again, women 
constitute a slim majority—51 
percent—of the admitted class.

ences. He will oversee 28 acade¬ 
mic departments and five divi¬ 
sions: the College, the Graduate 
School of Arts and Sciences, the 
School of General Studies, the 
School of International and Pub¬ 
lic Affairs, and the School of the 
Arts. Dr. Cohen, 56, succeeds 
Steven Marcus '48, who served 
as both vice president and Dean 
of the College. 

A neurobiologist who has 
written some 100 scientific arti¬ 
cles, abstracts, and chapters. Dr. 
Cohen was previously dean of 
the graduate school at North¬ 
western, chairman of neuro¬ 
science at the University of Vir¬ 
ginia, and chairman of neurobi¬ 
ology at SUNY-Stony Brook. He 
graduated magna cum laude 
from Harvard College in 1960 
and received his Ph.D. from 
Berkeley in 1963. 

The search committee was 
chaired by Provost Jonathan R. 
Cole '64, himself a former vice 
president for arts and sciences. 

■ Hitting the books: 

The long awaited renovation of 
Butler Library has begun with 
a $20 million installation of 
new electrical, plumbing, fire 
safety, heating, air condition¬ 
ing, ventilation, and telecom¬ 
munications systems. The 
Trustees approved funding in 
March for Phase I of a planned 
$70 million overhaul of the 
University libraries. Construc¬ 
tion was begun in May and is 
expected to last three years.

The subsequent phases of ren¬ 
ovation, reports Elaine Sloan, 
University Librarian and Vice 
President for Information Ser¬ 
vices, include provisions for a 
new College Library; vastly 
improved stacks; installation of 
multimedia work stations; reor¬ 
ganization of technical, adminis¬ 
trative and reference services; 
and an increase in library seating 
capacity from 940 to about 1700. 

The Columbia libraries, with 
6.5 million volumes, are the 
nation's seventh largest acade¬ 
mic collection. The renovation 
of Butler Library, which 
opened in 1934, has become 
one of the University's most 
urgent capital projects.

Faculty House on April 13. 
James Mirollo, the Parr Profes¬ 
sor of English and Comparative 
Literature, received the 34th 
annual Mark Van Doren Award 
for "humanity, devotion to truth 
and inspiring leadership." The 
20th Lionel Trilling Award, 
given annually for the best book 
written by a faculty member, 
went to Professor of Biological 
Sciences and former College 
Dean Robert E. Pollack '61 for 
his volume Signs of Life: The 
Language and Meanings of DNA. 

■ Jewish center: Work has 
begun on a new $6 million Cen¬ 
ter for Jewish Student Life on 
West 115th Street near Broad¬ 
way. The building is named for 
the family of University Trustee 
Robert K. Kraft '63, the Boston 
industrialist and owner of the 
New England Patriots football 
team, who has contributed $2 
million to the effort. The five- 
story center will contain class¬ 
rooms, conference rooms, a Beit 
Midrash (Judaica Studies Cen¬ 
ter), a lounge, an outdoor ter¬ 
race, and halls for lectures, wor¬ 
ship and large gatherings. 

The development committee 
for the project is co-chaired by 
New York Times Company 
chairman Arthur O. Sulzberger 
'51 and the author Herman 
Wouk '34, who spoke at the 
groundbreaking ceremony on 
April 25. Also present were Mr. 
Kraft, University President 
George Rupp, former College 
Dean Robert E. Pollack '61, 
and Rabbi Charles Sheer, who 
is marking 25 years as Colum¬ 
bia's Jewish chaplain.

compiled a 71-35 record, win¬ 
ning the 1991-92 Ivy League 
title and going to the NCAA 
tournament that season. 

■ New trustees: The 

Trustees of the University elected 
four new members to their ranks 
in March. They are Jerome A. 
Chazen, chairman of the board of 
Liz Claiborne, Inc.; Alfred Lemer 
'55, chairman and chief executive 
officer of MBNA Corp.; Michael 
E. Patterson, chief administrative 
officer of J. P. Morgan; and Lau- 
rans A. Mendelson '60, chairman 
of the board, president, and chief 
executive officer of HEICO Corp., 
who is Columbia's 97th Alumni 
Trustee. 

Trustees generally serve six- 
year terms; six of the 24 mem¬ 
bers of the board are nomi¬ 
nated by University alumni. 

■ College boards: The 

College's Board of Visitors has 
seven new members: Peter W. 
Schweitzer '60, president of 
S.G.D. Commodities Corp.; Leo 
Swergold '62, senior managing 
director of Furman Selz, Inc.; 
Donald L. Margolis '63, former 
vice president and controller of 
Toys "R" Us; Neill H. Brown- 
stein '66, managing general 
partner of Bessemer Venture 
Partners; Bradford R. Higgins 
'74, senior partner of Cam¬ 
bridge Partners, L.L.C.; Dirk 
Ziff '88, co-chairman of Ziff 
Brothers Investments; and Dr. 
Rebecka Belldegrun P'98, pres¬ 
ident of Intertech Corp. George 
M. Jaffin '24, Mel Schwartz 
'53, and Patricia C. Remmer 
recently left the board, having 
completed their terms. 


The leadership of the Alumni 
Association also underwent 
some changes this spring. Brian 
C. Krisberg '81, who had been 
vice president for university 
affairs, is now vice president for 
student affairs, replacing Arthur 
B. Spector '68. Mr. Krisberg's 
post will be filled by Ezra G. 
Levin '55. Paul A. Argenti '75 is 
the new vice president for pub¬ 
lic relations; he takes over from 
Lee J. Guittar '53. 

■ Academicians: Profes¬ 
sor of Chemistry Bruce Berne 
has been elected a Fellow of the 
American Academy of Arts 
and Sciences. Professor Berne is 
a pioneer in molecular dynam¬ 
ics, a method used to simulate 
many-body systems on com¬ 
puters, and has made major 
contributions to the theory of 
chemical reaction rates. 

The Academy was founded 
in 1780 by John Adams. Fleeted 
along with Mr. Berne, and 
bringing to 93 the number of 
Columbia faculty who are Fel¬ 
lows of the Academy, were P&S 
professors I. Bernard Wein¬ 
stein and Stephen P. Goff. 

■ Wise career move: 

Opportunities for career advis¬ 
ing will probably never be ade¬ 
quate enough for the graduat¬ 
ing senior who doesn't have 
a job. But in response to the 
recent Flynn Report on improv¬ 
ing student services, the Uni¬ 
versity's Center for Career Ser¬ 
vices has stepped up efforts to 
respond to undergraduates and 
now reports directly to the Col¬ 
lege and Engineering deans' 
offices. 


According to executive 
director Eileen Kohan, approx¬ 
imately 300 employers come to 
campus annually to conduct 
some 1000 interviews, consti¬ 
tuting the largest on-campus 
recruiting program in the Ivy 
League, save for Penn. Cur¬ 
rently the center lists some 
15,000 jobs a year, including 
2,000 internships, 5,000 part- 
time off-campus jobs and 3,000 
positions on campus. In addi¬ 
tion to offering such traditional 
resources as advice on writing 
resumes (which the office now 
processes to the tune of 9,000 a 
year). Career Services is plan¬ 
ning an annual "Interview 
Day" and weekly career panels. 

Alumni are encouraged to 
assist the office in its eforts.

■ Errata: The College Fund 
has announced the following 
corrections to its report on the 
42nd Annual Fund: 

Robert P. Adelman '52 should 
have been listed as a Fellow of 
the John Jay Associates; 

Donald Kursch '40, Melvin 
Hershkowitz '42, Louis Lerner 
'52, Edgar D. Altchek '61, 
Stephen R. Clineburg '63, and 
Lawrence H. Oliver '67 should 
have been listed as members of 
the John Jay Associates; 

Robert N. Butler '49 was 
incorrectly listed as deceased. 

In addition, Henry R. Black 
'63 was omitted from the list of 


Members of the John Jay Asso¬ 
ciates in the 41st Annual Report. 

The Fund Office regrets these 
errors. Any further corrections 
will be reported in future issues 
of CCT. 

■ In memoriam: The Col¬ 
lege recently mourned Professor 
of Physics Jacob Shaham, who 
died of heart failure on April 20 
at the age of 52. He lived in the 
Riverdale section of the Bronx. 

Dr. Shaham was among the 
world's leading theoretical astro¬ 
physicists in the study of neutron 
stars and pulsars; he contributed 
important analyses of peculiari¬ 
ties in the spin and radio frequen¬ 
cies of pulsars. In 1994, with 
Associate Professor of Astronomy 
James Applegate, he theorized 
that two forces—solar wind and 
gravitation—were responsible for 
causing the recently discovered 
"Black Widow Pulsar" to devour 
its companion star while dou¬ 
bling the companion's size and 
increasing its luminosity. 

Dr. Shaham received his Ph.D. 
from Hebrew University of 
Jerusalem in 1971 and became 
professor of physics at its Racah 
Institute of Physics in 1977, the 
university's youngest full profes¬ 
sor at that time. In 1984 he was 
appointed professor of physics at 
Columbia, later serving as deputy 
chairman of the department and 
co-director of the Columbia 
Astrophysics Laboratory. 

Dr. Shaham is survived by 
his wife, the former Meira 
Diskin, two sons, Shai '89 and 
Gil '93, and a daughter, Orli '97.

mode but still managing to look wholesome, sways and 
smiles as the band's undeniable energy washes over them. 

Joe Saba '93 is so wrapped up in his keyboard, it's almost 
playing him. Meanwhile, lead vocalist Carolyn Kelly '95 
bounces in her overalls and blue baseball cap, her powerful 
voice snaking around the band's soulful twists and turns. 

The Electric Company works hard at its music. So do the 
many other bands that now flourish on the campus, the heirs 
to a musical tradition that includes Art 
Garfunkel and Hank Davis in the early 
60's, Sha Na Na and the Soul Syndicate 
in the late 60's, So What in the 70's, the 
Casuals and the Ex-Husbands in the 
80's, and many more too numerous to 
mention or even know about. The rock 
and pop scene has grown and persisted, 
alongside with, and often overlapping 
with, performance, study and enjoy¬ 
ment of classical, jazz, Latin, and an 
incredible variety of other music—all 
pointing up, in a peculiarly rock & roll 
way, the diversity, ambition, talent 
and guts of Columbia's musical 
youth. 

O f course, musical life at 
Columbia has long had a 
solid base, albeit in more 
traditional forms. The 
University Orchestra, the Glee Club, 
the Collegium Musicum, the 
Barnard-Columbia Chorus, the 
Kingsmen and the Metrotones are 
still in full swing. WKCR continues to be one of New 
York's premier radio stations, and does so without playing 
much rock at all. The Varsity Show is in its 102nd year. The 
Marching Band continues to form unusual shapes on Baker 
Field. Recitals featuring anything from Early Music to 
Brazilian art songs to the most avant-garde contemporary 
works occur every few days in venues like St. Paul's Chapel 
and Miller Theatre (which is becoming one of the city's 
trendiest smaller halls). The music department, a home for 
distinguished composers and teachers from Edward 
MacDowell to Jack Beeson to Mario Davidovsky, has trained 
such notable composers as John Corigliano '59 and Charles

Wuorinen '61. The College is now nurturing young artists 
through its joint program with the Juilliard School, and still 
requires all students to take Music Humanities. 

Come outside of the hushed recital halls and the ear-train¬ 
ing classes, however, and you'll find a bunch of students 
with electric guitars. They have been there a long time, they 
show no signs of leaving, and they are drawing a crowd. 

One place these crowds gather is at The 'Plex, where the 
Columbia Concert Committee occasionally spotlights cam¬ 
pus bands. On a recent Friday, the evening began with the 
noisy, jokey punk-funk of Gallina, an NYU-Columbia band 
that includes Dave Hahn '96 and Mitch Gelber '97. An 
impromptu dance contest ensued during their set. They were 
followed by the earnest folk-rock of Andrew Vladek '92 and 
his band. Big Matilda (Atsushi Murase '95 and Paul Chuffo 
'95). Finally, at 1 a.m., Tom Frank '97, Paul Maroon '96 and 
Matt Barrick '97, all currently taking time off to pursue this 
band thing, made a dramatic entrance with their punk band 
Jonathan Fire’^eater. Their singer, Stuart Lupton, wearing 
what looked like a white version of a Beefeater's hat and a 
white leather coat that could probably tell some stories, float¬ 
ed onstage after the rest of the band had started playing. As 
he climbed onto a chair and sang leaning over the crowd like 
a preacher, the audience, rather small and demure but defi¬ 
nitely listening, drew up to the stage and relished 
Fire’^^eater's lurching, triumphant noise. 

Columbia's rock, pop and folk musicians have a number 
of options for performance space: Postcrypt under St. Paul's 
Chapel, Barnard's Macintosh Student Center, dorm parties, 
frat parties, a weekly daytime Student Activities-sponsored 
performance in Ferris Booth Hall's Levien Lounge (known as 
"The Spot"), Miller Theatre, The 'Plex, Wollman Auditorium 
and, of course, the Steps. Just off campus, the West End now 
has a downstairs rock cave, painted all black like a real 
Avenue A dive. 

F or all the activity on the Heights, most starry eyes 
are fixed southward. Band members say, "We've 
played downtown a couple of times," with 
unabashed pride. 

The Insteps, a popular band among students, are old pros 
at it. In March, at Brownies in the East Village, this 11-piece 
band—although it was just nine that night—gave one of their 
many downtown shows. Their music was rapid-fire ska (a 
Jamaican blend of rock and reggae) tinged with soul. The 
crowd was also a mixture: a clump of leaping guys in t-shirts 
yelling "Columbia!" and "Phi Ep!" and East Villagers with 
slicked-back hair and dark lipstick sitting coolly on stools 
(although they were tapping their toes). The band members 
come from all over; the Columbians are Keith Crockett '95 on 
sax, David Nelson '96 on trombone, and Noah Roy '95, one of 
two singers. Mr. Roy, a biology major from Manhattan, is very 
tall, and his voice comes out gravelly but warm as he grins at 
the audience and paces with the microphone. The audience 
goes crazy when they sing, "Every slacker is a star..." 

But it's clear from their energy and their ability (especially 
Mr. Crockett's heartfelt sax solo) that they are anything but 
slackers. Neither are the Electric Company, whose slick, sinu¬ 
ous blend of rock and jazz is delivered with the utmost pro¬ 
fessionalism. The band claims influences ranging from 
Thelonious Monk to the Beastie Boys. Bassist Mark Blyth says 
in his thick Scottish brogue, "We're kind of like a musical 
Long Island Iced Tea. You think if you throw all this together. 


it's never going to taste nice, and somehow it does." 

A native of Dundee, Mr. Blyth is a Ph.D candidate in polit¬ 
ical science; last semester he was a Contemporary Civili¬ 
zation instructor. Lead singer Carolyn Kelly is a music major 
whose favorite classes are in medieval music. Her studies 
and her band overlap rarely. "In the pop-rock thing, there's 
very little room for all that analysis," she says. "Studying 
music and performing music are two different ends entirely, 
and that's fine with me." 

M iller Theatre (formerly McMillin) is not just for 
chamber music. Over the years, its stage has 
seen Martha and the Vandellas, Archie Shepp, 
Lou Reed, the Ex-Husbands, and now the 
Columbia band Mama Joy, named for one of the neighbor¬ 
hood's best-loved delis. At their show there on a recent 
Saturday night, some students slouched happily in their 
seats while others danced, often alone, in the aisles. Fronted 
by singer Rozz Nash '95, the band mixes jazz and rhythm & 
blues with dashes of rock and rap. They do mostly original 
material that they create together, and in performance are 
almost a revue, complete with horn section, stand-up bass 
and boogeying back-up singers. 

Ms. Nash, a psychology major from San Francisco, also has 
a mellow jazz and r&b quintet that plays everywhere from 
Nell's, a 14th Street club with a $10 cover, to a recent party in 
the River Hall basement to celebrate the dorm's new cappuc¬ 
cino maker (people were dancing slowly and dreamily while 
clutching mugs). 

Jeff Ryan '95 says his group, the Black Lotus, is "not really 
a band, it's more like a thing. It's all improv, the concerts are 
six hours long. There are seven core members, but at times 
the band has been as big as 26. It's less music than total con¬ 
fusion." Their concerts are not unlike performance art. They 
scored an old silent film at Barnard's Altschul Hall, they let 
crickets loose on stage at a fraternity show, and they held a 
three-hour concert shown on CTV Their music is mostly 
instrumental, swirling cauldrons of dark, echoey guitar, 
punctuated by occasional rhythms and distorted yelling. 

I f these bands all sound very different, that reflects New 
York, where you can find all the cultural and musical 
elements these students have stirred together to make 
their own distinctive sounds. It is also a good reflection 
of pop music today, which has grown into a huge industry 
with "product" marketed to many different age groups and 
tastes. Sid Holt '79, now managing editor of Rolling Stone, 
remembers the proliferation of punk and New Wave bands 
on campus in the early 80's, and is not surprised by the 
musical diversity today. "That reflects what's going on in 
general. Music is definitely fragmented. That punk moment 
was a concentrated moment." Jeff Ryan, who will be working 
at a punk-rock record label after he graduates, agrees with 
him. These days, he says, "It's hard to entertain more than 
two people at a time." 

New York's music scene is competitive, varied, sometimes 
overwhelming. The Electric Company's guitarist, Alex 
Brown '93, was one who felt he should make the most of 
being in the city. "I came here, sang the first semester [in the 
Notes and Keys], and then said, 'Gee, I'm in New York. I 
could be in a band!'" Michael Azerrad '83, then a drummer, 
now a writer on rock & roll topics, says, "Not only is there a 
lot of great stuff around you all the time, but you feel sort of

PHOTOS: PHILIPPE CHENG CaTupus musiclans draw on 

many sources for their works. 

One of the Electric Company's songs, "Model Companion," 
was inspired by a Chekhov story called "Anyuta." "It's beauti¬ 
ful. I was trying to get the mood of the story across in the song 
and update it a bit," explains the writer, Joe Saba, who works 
days writing music for ABC News programs. Another of his 
songs, "Might Disappear"—with the lyrics "I know that some 
day/my life will settle down/I'11 have a little castle and be 
forced to wear a crown"—is about "being a white kid in the 
suburbs and trying to reconcile that with what your expecta¬ 
tions are and what you're supposed to do." Rozz Nash wrote 
the lyrics for a Mama Joy song about a 1920's silver dollar her 
late father gave her: "Lately I've been staring at my silver 
coin/hoping for a spiritual occurrence." 

Sometimes, the students face as many obstacles as oppor¬ 
tunities. 

Andrew Vladek's creativity ran up against the Columbia 
bureaucracy. When he was a sophomore, playing any musi¬ 
cal instrument was against dorm policy, and Mr. Vladek was 
put on dorm warning merely for allowing his folkie stylings 
to reach the ears of the head resident. But when he discov¬ 
ered a rule that said "noise" was okay as long as it wasn't 
disruptive, Mr. Vladek set out to have music redefined as 
"noise." 

"I petitioned the people on my floor to make sure I wasn't 
bothering anyone," he recalls. "Then I went to the U.D.C. 
[Undergraduate Dormitory Council] and stated my case, and 
they were nice enough to vote and change the policy. So I 
guess it was my initiative, but the good nature and rationali¬ 
ty of the student body... Play on brother, strum on sister." 


O n a small campus in a crowded city, rehearsal 

space is at a premium. Mr. Vladek's band mem¬ 
bers are both seniors living in a dorm, where 
they practice in a closet. "It's quite cozy," he says. 
Some bands rehearse in fraternity basements in exchange for 
playing parties. The Electric Company practices in the leg¬ 
endary Music Building, a collection of battle-scarred 
rehearsal rooms at 39th Street and Eighth Avenue (Madonna 
is rumored to have lived in one of them for a time), where 
the light is rather dim and their heads scrape alarmingly 
close to the ceiling. The Insteps also rehearse downtown, in a 
studio called Eunkadelic, for $20 an hour. Saxophonist Keith 
Crockett, who'll be going to work at the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York upon graduation, feels that Columbia 
might spring for these types of facilities. "There's one prac¬ 
tice room space, which isn't very adequate. Usually you have 
to wait 45 minutes or so because they're all filled up, and 
they don't really have very good pianos." Some students and 
musicians also wish there was a regular on-campus perfor¬ 
mance venue; this might help coalesce the various bands into 
more of a "scene" as well as get around the issue of 21-and- 
over policies for entering certain clubs. 

Making rehearsals, running downtown for a midnight 
gig—living the band life is hard enough without having to 
go to school at the same time. "It's pretty much a drag," says 
David Hahn '95 of Gallina. "We only get to practice once a 
week for about three hours. If I didn't have so much home¬ 
work to do, I would probably practice guitar a lot more. But 1 
practice maybe two hours a day." 

Having to deal with the music business provides 
Columbia's rock and rollers with another kind of education. 
"It's definitely an introduction to the seamier side of New 
York," says the Electric Company's Alex Brown. His band 
will arrive at a club to find their set has been cut by 25 per¬ 
cent, they're going on a half-hour earlier than planned, and 
when it's all over, the club will get most of the money. As for 
that elusive record contract, "That's one area where the 
Columbia degree, aside from a basic semi-intelligence that 
we're all supposed to have, is practically meaningless," says 
keyboardist Saba. "It's not a reason for anyone to sign you." 

And yes, the bands must even deal with groupies. 
Referring to the vociferous jumpers at the Insteps' gig, Noah 
Roy says, "There are a lot of people at Columbia who like us, 
but there's this weird bloc, that would be the swimmers, who 
are extremely, extremely devoted... I happen to be personal 
friends with a bunch of them, because I'm in the same frat." 
Asked to describe the Black Lotus's fan base, Jeff Ryan says, 
"They tend to be the kind of people who hand out weird 
pamphlets and are afraid their phones are being tapped."

Columbia College Today 


Columbia's new jazz adventurer 


BY Lee Lowenfish '63 



ne of the most intriguing and 
promising developments in the jazz 
of the 1990's is the blossoming of 
major talent on liberal arts campus¬ 
es. Harvard's Joshua Redman has 
rocketed to fame since winning the 
1991 saxophone competition spon¬ 
sored by the Thelonious Monk 
Foundation, and now a son of Columbia is also rapidly mak¬ 
ing a name for himself: Patrick Zimmerli '90, a tenor saxo¬ 
phonist from West Hartford, Conn., who reached the semi¬ 
finals of the 1991 Monk competition and won the Monk 
Foundation prize for finest original jazz competition in 1993. 

Possessor of a robust, straight-ahead sound as well as rhyth¬ 
mic and compositional brilliance, Zimmerli has joined the rairks 
of Columbia graduates who have made major contributions to 
the field of jazz. They include bassist Cameron Brown '69, 
reedist Sam Morrison '73 (who played with Miles Davis in the 
1970's), and such stylistically diverse pianists as Marc Copland 
'70 (known formerly as Marc Cohen), Armen Donehan '72, and 
the prodigiously talented Dick Hyman '48. There is also a lin¬ 
eage of Columbia grads who have made important contribu¬ 
tions to the jazz world as producers, critics, broadcasters and 
historians, among them Ralph J. Gleason '38, Orrin Keepnews 
'43, Walter Schaap '37, and his son, Phil Schaap '73. 

"I've known too many students who were disenchanted 
by cynical music school teachers," says Mr. Zimmerli. "I 
didn't want jazz classes forced on me." The music never 
had to be coerced out of him: he started on clarinet at age 
six and then switched to the saxophone in the sixth grade 
("I somehow had the mistaken notion that you couldn't 
improvise on clarinet," he confides sheepishly). By the time 
he was in high school, Patrick was winning prestigious sax 
competitions sponsored by downbeat magazine and the 
International Association of Jazz Educators. 

Then, while still a senior in high school, Mr. Zimmerli 
experienced something akin to a musical conversion. "I heard 
Bela Bartok's 'Concerto for Orchestra' for the first time, and I 
was blown away by the harmonies and rhythms," he recalls. 
"There has always been cross-pollination between jazz and 
modern music. Charlie Parker loved Stravinsky, and McCoy 
Tyner has obviously been influenced by Paul Hindemith." 

Coming to Columbia because of New York's diverse 
musical opportunities and the flexibility of the College cur¬ 
riculum, Mr. Zimmerli explored the Big Apple voraciously 
and on his own terms. "I enjoyed living in the Hewitt dorm 
at Barnard my first two years," he says. "I could easily hop 
on the #1 train to take me to music downtown." 

During his junior year, Mr. Zimmerli got more involved 
on campus as a member and manager of the fledgling 
Columbia Jazz Band. Started under the tutelage of Don 
Sickler, a gifted trumpeter, arranger, and indefatigable 
restorer of classic jazz charts, the band scheduled an ambi¬ 
tious Teachers College concert for the spring of 1989. It fea¬ 
tured the famed tenor saxophonist Joe Henderson, playing 


music he had arranged for a 1960's rehearsal band that he 
had co-led with trumpeter Freddie Hubbard. 

Don Sickler has continued to bring jazz legends to campus 
for an annual spring concert. In April, alto saxophonist Bobby 
Watson and drummer Thelonious Mortic, Jr. appeared with stu¬ 
dent chamber jazz groups at Miller Theater. Among the College 
jazz players already well regarded on the jazz scene are trum¬ 
peter Michael Leonhart '97, winner of a high school Presidential 
medal, and pianist Peter Delano '98, already a recorded artist. 

During his senior year, Mr. Zimmerli withdrew from active 
jazz work on campus, completing his double concentration in 
music and English literature while constantly improving his 
saxophone chops and compositional talents. Among his cre¬ 
ations was "The Paw," an intense, difficult 12-minute piece 
which topped 200 other entries for the 1993 Monk Pound- 
ation compositional prize. "The Paw" has been recorded as 
part of Mr. Zimmerli's first album as a leader, which will be 
out this summer on the Songlines label from Vancouver, B.C. 

Also this summer, Mr. Zimmerli plans to complete his 

master's thesis for the Columbia

For all the intellectually challenging aspects of his musical 
persona, Patrick Zimmerli also knows how to make a living 
with music in the real world. He is the co-composer of music 
for a recent New York Times TV commercial (starring Henry 
Kissinger). "It's like a baroque fugue, and I enjoyed writing 
it," he says. And, most satisfyingly Mr. Zimmerli spent the 
first six weeks of 1995 touring southern Africa with the Jazz 
Ambassadors, a quintet sponsored by the Monk Foundation. 

The Jazz City label will release a CD of tour material this fall. 

"The trip was the experience of a lifetime," recalls Mr. 

Zimmerli. He says he was inspired by the spectacular South 
African scenery, enthralled by a meeting with Johnnie Mekoa 
(a musician who knew Monk and who has dedicated a jazz 
school in his honor in Daveyton, near Johannesbuig), and 
overwhelmed when a chorus of schoolchildren on the island of 
Mauritius sang the Gershwins' "But Not For Me" for their visi¬ 
tors in French. "But the real musical highlight was to jam with 
some young rural Ethiopians in Addis Ababa. They not only 
couldn't speak English, they couldn't even speak their native 
tongues!" says Mr. Zimmerli. "We were still able to make great 
music together because we could communicate rhythmically."

Columbia College Today 


Pump up the volutne 

In an informal survey, Columbia College Today asked 
some students about the music they like. 


Anthony Ochipinti '97 (East Asian studies, Hilo, Hawaii): I 
listen to classical, New Age, and jazz. I listen to Japanese 
and Chinese music and go to culture shows. I'm a die-hard 
Enya fan. Music for me is kind of background—that's why 
I can listen to any of my CD's a hundred times and not get 
tired of it. 

Jody Gibney '97 (Russian history major, Santa Barbara, 
Calif.): I like a lot of crappy music because of the memo¬ 
ries attached to it: 80's cheese, jazz, classical. I like some 
punk, such as Misfits, old Minor Threat, Dead Kennedys, 
Cramps. And I like metal—old Metallica, White Zombie, 
old Soundgarden. Also Motown and disco music that has 
a lot of bass. I've played bass since sophomore year in 
high school. That explains the jazz and a lot of the metal. 

I was rebellious when I was younger—I liked the image 
and then I liked the music. I've pulled out a lot of old music, 
but it's not the same the second time around. I'm always in 
a phase, but I'm out of phases. I need a new phase. 

Liz Young '97 (classics major, Boston): I'm having a music 
crisis! I really don't think I have anything to say. My radio 
show on WKCR last night played Swedish and Finnish 
fiddle music. I listened to other stuff, like Bulgarian music, 
before coming here. 

Michelle Ahn '98 (major undecided, Woodcliff Lake, N.J.): I 
can pretty much tolerate anything except rap. I guess my 
favorite group is this kind of New Wave group. Erasure. 
And I love classical music. I like the New Age-type music, 
techno. It all depends on my mood, really. 

J. F. Ryan '95 (film major, Seattle): I like psychedelic music, 
man. Devo, Melvins, and David Bowie. I'm a lover of all 
music. I worked at Kill Rock Stars, a record label, last 
summer. I was a slave of indie rock—did the grunt work. 

Sanjay Sanghoee '95 (computer science, Delhi, India): I love 
Duran Duran. We got rid of our R.A. this week. He could¬ 
n't stand the fact that Td play "A View to a Kill" about 
200 times in a row. 


Bryonn Bain '95 (poli sci major. New York City "and all 
over—I was a military brat"): I like Stevie Wonder and a lot 
of older r&b and soul, like Donnie Hathaway and Smokey 
Robinson. For new stuff, it's rap and hip-hop, like KRS-1. 
He's from the Bronx, did a whole stop-the-violence album 
in the 80's. He talks about the political situation in the 
black community—he's a positive influence. I like Jem and 
Keith Murray—he uses a lot of metaphors and complex 
vocabulary. My dad was a musician in Trinidad before his 
army service, so I learned to like traditional calypso and 
soca. The closest I get to what people at Columbia like is 
Peter Tosh and Bob Marley and the older reggae stuff, 
which is still popular at dance clubs like the Soul Kitchen. 
And I sing in an r&b group called Diorgen. 

Adam Mortimer '95 (English major, Boston): I like to listen 
to longwave radio static because it jams signals that peo¬ 
ple are trying to send into my brain. On sunny Sunday 
afternoons, I like a good Elvis tune. 

Matt Moses '97 (film major, Hamden, Conn.): The more bmtal 
and painful it is, the more I enjoy it. If music's not some sort 
of assault, it's uninteresting. My band, Malta, is heralding 
the end of the beginning of music, while trying to proclaim 
the beginning of the end. Malta is the fools of the world 
picking up instmments and saying, "Look at me. Mom!" 

Amy Benson '95 (history major, Calabasas, Calif.): I really 
pretty much only listen to women. Mostly I have four 
CDs and I keep playing them over and over again— 
Indigo Girls, Tracy Chapman. The Cranberries are pretty 
good. I used to love Melissa Etheridge, but I think she's a 
little too trendy now. 1 think that she's sold out. But I used 
to be her biggest fan. 

Rachel Page '96 (East Asian studies, Barrington, R.I.): Music 
sort of is an identity thing, a clothing thing. It really does 
stamp you. People are kind of afraid to say what they're 
really into. 

—gathered by Rebecca Turner '87 and Michele Laudig '97

R ozz Nash says she's going to stick it out for a 

while, at least. "I'm planning on staying in New 
York, giving myself three or four years to sing full 
time, try to make it, I guess. After that, if it doesn't 
go the way 1 want it to. I'll just go to grad school [in psychol¬ 
ogy] and continue with my life." 

There is something especially compatible about the rock & 
roll spirit and Columbia: the tendency to cherish certain tra¬ 
ditions and want to smash them at the same time. It's easy to 


imagine that one day, many years from now, a couple of stu¬ 
dents will tumble out of Furnald on a spring Saturday and 
hear the hollow sound of guitars and drums wailing from 
somewhere around the Steps, slightly off-key in the distance, 
resonating off the brick and limestone and floating off into 
the Manhattan sky. As they get closer, the music will get 
louder and bend into key, and when they're right in front, 
they will fling down their books and dance. 


Rebecca Turner '87, a freelance writer in New York, contributes 
to music publications such as The New York Review of Rock, 
The Big Takeover and College Music Journal.

The Race to Make the Bomb 


The Manhattan Project: 

Columbia's 
wartime secret 

BY Laurence Lippsett 


I n the pre-electronic mail days of 1939, the year Hitler 
invaded Poland, the Danish physicist Niels Bohr car¬ 
ried important scientific news to the New World 
aboard a transatlantic steamer. He and only perhaps a 
half-dozen others in the world knew about the tanta¬ 
lizing but inexplicable results of a recent experiment: 
Two German scientists had bombarded uranium with subatom¬ 
ic particles called neutrons and, to their surprise, produced bari¬ 
um, an element about half the atomic weight of uranium. 

When the word reached Momingside Heights, it sparked a 
dizzying cascade of events. Within days, Columbia physicists 
working in Pupin Physics Laboratories demonstrated that neu¬ 
trons could split uranium atoms, releasing enormous power. 
Within weeks, they ascertained that the process released enough 
neutrons to split more uranium atoms and spark a chain reac¬ 
tion. Within months, the scientists contacted skeptical govern¬ 
ment officials about the potential of their experiments. And 
within a year, they secured the first federal contract to explore 
the harnessing of atomic power for energy, or, for bombs—and 
had built the first atomic pile. 

Cloaked in wartime secrecy, attracting almost no attention, 
Columbia had inaugurated what came to be known as the 
Manhattan Project—a $2 billion enterprise that involved thou¬ 
sands of scientists and military personnel and eventually 
spawned the huge military-industrial complex of federal labo¬ 
ratories and weapons plants that exists today. That whole 
establishment, wrote Spencer R. Weart in his biography of the 
atomic physicist Leo Szilard, "can be traced back to a few 
people sitting at laboratory benches discussing the peculiar 
behavior of one type of atom." Many of those people were at 
Columbia, where at the time, "a great deal of the world's 
knowledge of neutron physics was centered," said William W. 
Havens, then a lecturer and now Professor Emeritus of Physics. 
The 1945 annual report of Columbia President Nicholas 
Murray Butler noted that "more than 250 members of the 
Scientific Staff and more than 1,200 others" were engaged in 
research that occupied parts of Havemeyer, Pupin, and 
Schermerhorn Halls, most of a large building at 133d Street 
and Broadway, and numerous other structures on and around 
campus. 


It was with such resources that Columbia launched a 
feverish project with awesome moral implications, which 
ushered in an entirely new era of warfare and world politics 
heralded by the mushroom cloud that burst above 
Hiroshima 50 years ago. 

I n the waning days of 1938, the German physicists Otto 
Hahn and Fritz Strassman found that neutron bombard¬ 
ment of uranium produced barium. Puzzled, they wrote 
to Lise Meitner, an Austrian physicist who had fled 
Nazism and moved to Sweden. "Perhaps you can suggest 
some fantastic explanation," Hahn wrote. "We understand 
that it really can't break up into barium... .So try to think of 
some other possibility." 

Meitner and her nephew Otto Frisch, also a physicist, spec¬ 
ulated that barium was created when uranium nuclei split 
into two smaller nuclei. On January 6,1939, Frisch disscussed 
their theory with Bohr, who was scheduled to leave the next 
morning for the United States to work at the Institute for 
Advanced Study in Princeton. In the days after Bohr's arrival, 
two Columbia physicists, Willis Lamb and 1.1. Rabi, who both 
later won the Nobel Prize, happened to be in Princeton, and 
on January 16 they returned to New York and shared the 
news with Enrico Fermi, the Nobel Laureate physicist who 
had fled fascist Italy to teach at Columbia. 

On January 25, Fermi dropped by the office of John R. 
Dunning, the physicist and later dean of the School of 
Engineering and Applied Science. Over lunch at the (then) 
Men's Faculty Club, they discussed an experiment that 
Dunning carried out later that night with other Columbia 
scientists in the basement of Pupin. They bombarded a thin 
plate covered with uranium oxide with neutrons and 
watched as green lines leaped upward on an oscilloscope 
screen. In his laboratory notebook, Dunning called them 
"enormous kicks," each indicating a large amount of energy 
being generated. By midnight, the theory of nuclear fission 
was fact. The next day, Dunning wrote in his notebook: 
"Believe we have observed a new phenomenon of far-reach¬ 
ing consequence." (Unknown to any American, Frisch had 
conducted a similar experiment 10 days earlier.) 












"This requires action," said 
President Roosevelt, setting 
the project in motion.

seventh floor of Pupin to measure the amount of neutrons 
emitted from fissioning uranium. 

"After two days of preparation everything was ready and 
all we had to do was to turn a switch, lean back and watch 
the screen of a television tube," Szilard later recalled. "If 
flashes of light appeared on the screen, that would mean that 
neutrons were emitted in the fission process of uranium, and 
this, in turn, would mean that the large-scale liberation of 
atomic energy was just around the corner. We turned the 
switch and we saw the flashes. We watched them for a little 
while and then we switched everything off and went home. 

That night there was little doubt in my mind the world was 
headed for grief." 

W orking independently in Pupin, Fermi and a 
graduate student, Herbert Anderson, used a 
different apparatus to confirm almost simulta¬ 
neously that each fission produced an average 
of two neutrons, making a chain reaction theoretically possi¬ 
ble. At this juncture, the scientists began to promulgate a self- 
imposed and unprecedented code of silence. In his 1954 
speech, Fermi related how Szilard startled the scientific com¬ 
munity by proposing that with war in the air, and given "the 
danger that atomic energy and possibly atomic weapons could 
become the chief tool for the Nazis to enslave the world, it 
was the duty of the physicists to depart from what had been 
the tradition of publishing significant results" as soon as pos¬ 
sible. Instead, Szilard urged his compatriots to "keep back 
some results until it was clear whether these results were 
potentially dangerous or potentially helpful to our side." 

But there was one audience these scientists did want to 
inform: the U.S. government. On March 16,1939, the day Hitler 
annexed Czechoslovakia, Columbia's Dean of Graduate 
Faculties, George B. Pegram, called Admiral Stanford C. Hooper 
in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, who agreed to see 
Fermi. The scientist carried a letter from Pegram that spoke of 
experiments at Columbia which indicated "that uranium might 
be used as an explosive that would liberate a million times as 
much energy per pound as any known explosive." 

The Navy showed little interest. 

Determined to convince the government, Szilard con¬ 
spired with two fellow Hungarian-born physicists who had 
fled Nazism: Edward Teller, who was then teaching at 
Columbia, and Eugene Wigner of Princeton. They persuaded 
the world's best-known and respected physicist, Albert 
Einstein, to write a letter to President Roosevelt, alerting him 
to the potential, good and bad, of atomic energy. 

Szilard met with Alexander Sachs '12, who had helped 
write speeches for Roosevelt and served as an economist for 
three years in PDR's National Recovery Administration. 

Sachs agreed to carry Einstein's letter personally to the 
President. On October 11, 1939, Sachs visited FDR, and in his 
own words told him of the recent research in nuclear physics 
and its potential for energy and destruction. FDR reportedly 
declared, "This requires action." Ten days later, the first 
meeting of the newly created Advisory Committee on 
Uranium convened. When asked how much money would 

"There was little doubt in my mind the 
Szilard when he saw the first flashes 


Physicists immediately real¬ 
ized the Promethean ramifica¬ 
tions of the discovery. In his 
Pulitzer Prize-winning book 
The Making of the Atomic Bomb, 
Richard Rhodes described a 
scene witnessed a few days 
later by the Columbia physi¬ 
cist George Uhlenbeck, who 
shared an office in Pupin with 
Fermi: "Fermi was standing at 
his panoramic office window 
high in the physics tower 
looking down the gray winter 
length of Manhattan Island, its 
streets alive as always with 
vendors and taxis and crowds. 
He cupped his hands as if he 
were holding a ball. 'A little 
bomb like that,' he said sim¬ 
ply. .. 'and it would all disappear.' " 

"It's hard to re-create the attitude at the time," Professor 
Havens said recently. "The Germans had a lot of brilliant 
people who had been working on atomic energy and we did¬ 
n't know how far along they were on a bomb. We had every 
incentive to get a bomb first, and we had no idea if one ever 
could be constructed. Until you got done with one experi¬ 
ment, you didn't know what to do next. We tried to do as 
much as we could simultaneously and we worked very hard. 
We would run the cyclotron all night and then I'd teach 
classes at 8 a.m. and then go home and take a nap." 

T he discovery that individual uranium atoms could 
fission fueled only atomic potential, not an atomic 
bomb. To produce one, millions of atoms would 
have to be split in a millionth of a second. That 
would happen only if fission liberated neutrons from nuclei, 
which split other uranium nuclei in a chain reaction—a 
process that clearly did not occur naturally in an ordinary 
lump of uranium. 

Bohr quickly came up with a theoretical explanation. 
Uranium came in at least two isotopes, U-238 and U-235. The 
latter, with its odd atomic mass, fissioned easily. U-238 did 
not, and in fact absorbed neutrons. Since uranium contained 
139 times more U-238 than U-235, neutrons liberated by fis¬ 
sion would much more likely be absorbed by U-238 or by 
other impurities, or shoot aimlessly into space, rather than 
hit another atom of U-235. 

So the question became: Could fission produce sufficient 
neutrons to overcome these hurdles, hit more U-235's and 
produce a self-sustaining chain reaction? In a speech Fermi 
gave at McMillin Theatre a few months before he died in 
1954, he said the solution was "a matter of numbers": If fis¬ 
sion released enough neutrons, a chain reaction was nearly 
unstoppable; too few and it was unstartable. 

On March 3,1939, two Columbia physicists, Leo Szilard 
and Walter Zinn, performed an historic experiment on the 



Columbia physicist Leo 
Szilard urged that atomic 
experiments be shielded in 
secrecy.

be needed to launch research. Teller responded with a first- 
year figure of $6,000. Later he reminisced: "My friends 
blamed me because the great enterprise of nuclear energy 
was to start with such a pittance." 

The $6,000 bought Fermi and Szilard lots of graphite, 
the greasy black stuff in pencils, which acted as a medium 
to slow down neutrons so they would not be absorbed by 
U-238 atoms and could remain free to hit U-235 atoms 
("Physicists on the seventh floor of Pupin Laboratories 
started looking like coal miners," Fermi said). The result¬ 
ing graphite mound, interspersed with uranium, eventual¬ 
ly rose to the height of Pupin's ceilings and by July 1941 
weighed about seven tons. 

"We went to Dean Pegram, who was then the man who 
could carry magic around the University, and we explained 
to him that we needed a big room," Fermi said. "And when 
we say 'big,' we mean a really big room. Perhaps he made a 
crack about a church not being the most suited place for a 
physics laboratory, but I think a church would have been just 
precisely what we wanted. Well, he scouted around the cam¬ 
pus and we went with him to dark corridors and under vari¬ 
ous heating pipes and so on to visit possible sites for this 
experiment and eventually a big room, not a church, but 
something that might have compared in size with a church, 
was discovered in Schermerhorn." 

There they constructed a new pile of graphite bricks and 
cans of uranium oxide. "Well," Fermi continued, "we were 
reasonably strong, but I mean we were, after all, thinkers. So 
Dean Pegram looked around and said, 'Well that seems to be 
a job a little bit beyond your feeble strength, but there is a 
football squad at Columbia that contains a dozen or so very 
husky boys who take jobs by the hour just to carry them 
through college. Why don't you hire them?' 

"And it was a marvelous idea; it was really a pleasure for 
us to direct the work of these husky boys, canning urani¬ 
um—just shoving it in—handling packs of 50 or 100 pounds 
with the same ease as another person would have handled 
three or four pounds." 

hile all this was going on, Dunning and a 
Columbia team that included the Nobel laure¬ 
ate chemist Harold Urey was pursuing a com¬ 
pletely different track. If Bohr was correct about 
U-235, a pure batch of the material would be easy to ignite. In 
the spring of 1939, Dunning wrote to Alfred Nier of the Uni¬ 
versity of Minnesota and proposed a kind of shotgun wedding: 
Nier had one of the world's few mass spectrometers, a device 
that could separate microscopic quantities of isotopes, and 
Columbia had one of the first cyclotrons, which could produce 
a continuous source of neutrons. "If you could separate effec¬ 
tively even tiny amounts of the two main (uranium) isotopes, 
there is a good chance that Booth and I could demonstrate, by 
bombarding them with the cyclotron, which isotope is respon¬ 
sible [for fission]," Dunning wrote. "If we could all cooperate 
and you aid us by separating some samples, then we could by 
combining forces, settle the whole matter." 

Dunning sent uranium samples to Nier. "The first separation 


of U-235 and U-238 was actu¬ 
ally accomplished on 
February 28 and 29,1940," 

Nier recalled. "On Friday 
afternoon, February 29,1 
posted the little samples (col¬ 
lected on nickel foil) on the 
margin of a handwritten let¬ 
ter and delivered them to the 
Minneapolis Post Office at 
about six o'clock. The letter 
was sent by airmail special 
delivery and arrived at 
Columbia University on 
Saturday. I was aroused early 
Sunday morning by a long¬ 
distance telephone call from 
John Dunning (who had 
worked through the night 
bombarding the samples 
with neutrons from the Columbia cyclotron). The Columbia 
test of the samples clearly showed that U-235 was responsible 
for the slow neutron fission of uranium." 

But no one seemed able to separate enough U-235 quickly 
enough. It would have taken 27,000 years, for example, for 
Nier's mass spectrometer to produce one gram of U-235. 
Scientists all over the country tried hundreds of methods. "At 
that time," Fermi said, "isotopes were considered almost mag¬ 
ically inseparable" and "it was not very clear that the job of 
separating large amounts of uranium-235 was one that could 
be taken seriously." At one point. Havens recalled, Urey had 
set up a column of chemistry apparatus in the open space in 
the stairwell of Havemeyer. Braced to the ceiling and banis¬ 
ters, it rose several flights and was passed daily by anyone 
using the stairs. 

Finally, the Columbia team hit upon a process called 
gaseous diffusion. It involved pumping uranium gas against a 
porous barrier of sheet metal with millions of submicroscopic 
openings per square inch, allowing the lighter molecules con¬ 
taining U-235 to pass through more rapidly than the heavier 
U-238 molecules. "These sheets were formed into tubes which 
were enclosed in an airtight vessel, the diffuser," wrote Gen. 
Leslie R. Groves, director of the Manhattan Project, in his post¬ 
war memoir. "As the gas, uranium hexafluoride, was pumped 
through a long series, or cascade, of these tubes it tended to 
separate, the enriched gas moving up the cascade while the 
depleted move down." But with so little difference in mass 
between the hexafluoride of U-238 and U-235, a single diffu¬ 
sion step yielded little separation. Several thousand successive 
stages were thus required. 

By late 1942, Columbia had a gas diffusion pilot plant in 
Pupin that spilled over into a former Nash automobile plant on 
133rd Street and Broadway. The program, which was designated 
with the purposefully uninteresting name of Special Alloyed 
Materials (SAM) Laboratory, employed more than 1,000 people 
at its peak and devised a workable barrier late in 1943.

Class Notes 



New York fetes Lorenz Hart '18 

Lorenz M. Hart '18, the legendary lyricist of such standards as “The 
Lady is a Tramp," "My Funny Valentine," "Isn't It Romantic?" and 
"Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered," would have marked his 100th 
birthday on May 2. In his honor. New York City Mayor Rudolph Giu¬ 
liani proclaimed May 2-9 to be Lorenz Hart Week, and musical trib¬ 
utes were heard around Mr. Hart's hometown: The New York City 
Center's Encores! series presented Patti LuPone and Bebe Neuwirth 
in four performances of Mr. Hart's classic Pal Joey, his last collabora¬ 
tion with longtime partner Richard Rodgers '23; the show was 
adapted for the occasion by Terrence McNally '60. And on Mr. Hart’s 
centennial day, the cabaret singer Mary Cleere Haran's Rodgers and 
Hart show This Funny World opened a four-week engagement at 
Rainbow and Stars. 

"The typical Rodgers and Hart ballad embodied romance with a 
melody and lyric blended so lightly that they seemed to breathe 
together," wrote Stephen Holden in The New York Times. But he 
noted also, "In his lyrics, as in his life. Hart stands as a com- 
pellingly lonely figure. Although he wrote dozens of songs that are 
playful, funny and filled with clever wordplay, it is the rueful vul¬ 
nerability beneath their surface that lends them a singular 
poignancy."

Ch.E., writes from Hallandale, 
Fla.: "A confession: In these later 
years, I appreciate what 1 learned 
to earn my bachelor's degree 
[more] than my engineering 


degree. I'm grateful to receive 
and enjoy Columbia College Today." 

Some Enchanted Evening: Cele¬ 
brating Oscar Hammerstein 2d ['16] 
was seen on PBS's Great Perfor¬ 
mances in March. Among the artists 
performing were Julie Andrews, 
who sang "A Cockeyed Optimist"; 
Bernadette Peters, with "What's 
the Use of Wond'rin'?"; and Patti 
LaBelle, backed by the Gay Men's 
Chorus, for "You'U Never Walk 
Alone." 


Early 20th-century alumni may 
be familiar with the name of 
Elbridge T. Gerry (Class of 1857), 
who died in 1927. The recent 
restoration of the death penalty in 
New York recalls this public man's 
work as chairman of the 1886 State 
Senate commission on capital pun¬ 
ishment which substituted elec¬ 
tricity for hanging (proponents 
believed the new form of execu¬ 
tion was more humane). Mr. Gerry 
was also president of the New 
York Society for the Prevention of 
Cruelty to Children, vice president 
of the ASPCA, and president of the 
Philolexian Society.

Famed witness Whittaker Cham¬ 
bers figures prominently in Harry 
& Teddy, a new Random House 
book by Thomas Griffith about the 
relationship of Time magazine 
publisher Henry Luce and 
Theodore White, his chief corre¬ 
spondent in wartime China. As 
Foreign News editor of Time, Whit 
would routinely rewrite White's 
dispatches, which detailed the cor¬ 
ruption and incompetence of Chi- 
ang Kai-shek's Nationalists, to 
instead reflect the menace posed 
by the Communist forces of Mao 
Tse-tung. Chambers's slanting of 
the news, which eventually 
caused White to quit Time, was 
driven by his fervent belief that 
the course of modem history was 
being determined by a titanic 
stmggle between communism 
and democracy, a clash that could 
end only with the destruction of 
either the Soviet Union or the 
United States. "Fortunately," 
writes Griffith, "Chambers's gift 
of prophecy, so admired by some. 


in the end proved fallible. A 
peaceful standoff could be 
achieved, and was, without one 
nation's destroying the other."

As an honored guest at the 
annual meeting of the Westport- 
Weston, Conn, chapter of the 
American Red Cross, Robert 
Schnitzer recounted some of his 
World War II experiences with 
the Red Cross in Asia: 

"In early 19441 took the first 20 
Red Cross women over the Hump 
from Burma to China. Since the 
Japanese held the lower Hump, 
we went over at 20,000 feet in a 
prop plane with no pressure, no 
oxygen, no heat, no light, not even 
bucket seats. A dozen planes went 
down on the Hump that night. 

"Throughout the two years in 
China—at Kunming and various 
satellite bases—I never met a Red 
Cross woman who didn't 'put the 
plus sign after the job.' ARC may 
have had a few 'bad apples' but I 
never found one in two years in 
China, or a year before that in 
North Africa and India. I can still 
get emotional remembering the

devotion and courage, both moral 
and physical, of the Red Cross 
women I was fortimate to work 
with."

We know that CCT has had a 
difficult time obtaining funds 
to publish what most Columbia 
alumni agree is a very worth¬ 
while publication. 

All College alumni receive 
CCT "free," but we have no way 
of knowing how many of our 
class read our Class Notes in 
CCT. My constant pleading to 
classmates to send me something 
for these Notes has had some 
response. Here is a letter from 
our very loyal classmate Rueben 
Abel dated February 25,1994: 

"Since you have opened up the 
Class Notes to extravagant boast¬ 
ing about offspring, let me submit 
this. 


"My son Rick (National Merit 
Scholar, Harvard A.B., Columbia 
Law LL.B., University of London, 
professor at Yale Law School for 
five years, now at UCLA Law 
School) has recently delivered a 
prestigious series of lectures in 
England. 

"My daughter Elizabeth 
(Swarthmore A.B. and Phi Beta 
Kappa, Columbia M.A., and 
Princeton Ph.D. English and 
comparative lit., professor at the 
University of Chicago), is now at 
the University of California at 
Berkeley. 

"As for our grandchildren— 
we are going to three commence¬ 
ments this Spring [1994]—Laura 
(Harvard A.B.) from Yale Law 


School; Sarah (San Diego A.B.), 
from NYU School of Social Work; 
and Heather, from Swarthmore. 
Benjamin, aged 9, is knocking 
them dead at his school. 

"Joe, you did ask for it!" 

One classmate I do hear from 
often is Milt Axenfeld. He has tele¬ 
phoned me from Arizona and 
Montana to chat. His most recent 
note informed me that he goes to 
"the Valley of the Sun in Arizona 
from November to April, then goes 
up to the Flathead Country on 
Spoon Lake in Northwest Montana 
from April to November." 

The only other classmate I 
hear from is Victor Coutant of 
Kalamazoo, Mich., with whom I 
exchange Christmas cards. 

The only other classmate I can 
report about is myself. Like most 
other people who are 86 years old, 
1 have deteriorated substantially 
in both health and brain. Without 
bothering you with details 
(because either you have the same 
problems yourselves, or know 
others who do), this is to inform 
you that I have stopped all outside 
activities which require any "brain" 
work. And these are my last Class 
Notes in Columbia College Today.

Our class has shown some signs 


of life this quarter. Jack Keville, a 
member of the Plastics Hall of 
Fame, took exception to what for¬ 
mer Dean of the College Carl F. 
Hovde '50 praised about the 
Columbia College Today coffee mug 
recently offered as a subscription 
premium: "It is made of honest 
pottery, not the flimsy plastic 
which one sometimes sees." Jack 
responded, "When you next drive 
your car, you'll be in a stronger, 
lighter vehicle because of over 
300 lbs. of plastic in it. You use 
plastics at least once every hour 
of your day. Plastics is now the 
third largest industry worldwide 
and continues to grow. Your life is 
better because of plastics." 

From Florida, Paul Bubendey 
writes: "After 62 years in bank¬ 
ing, will finally retire. Was direc¬ 
tor and shareholder of a bank in 
Miami for 16 years. We have sold 
the bank. Prior to that, was with 
Chemical Bank, N.Y. for 41 years. 
Have lived in Vero Beach since 
1975." 

Larry Eno writes with the sad 
news of the death of our class¬ 
mate, Josef H. Singer: "While in 
college, Joe was active in a num¬ 
ber of extra-curricular activities, 
serving as business manager of 
Columbia Review, and after gradu¬ 
ation he was active in alumni 
affairs. Joe was a graduate of the 
Law School but devoted himself 
to developing a unique hne of 
furniture that won critical acclaim. 
He is survived by his wife Chris¬ 
tine. Joe's death is a great loss to 
me because he and I had been 
close friends for 65 years. I know 
that a number of our classmates 
will be grieved to hear this news 
for Joe was an outstanding per¬ 
son. Hope all is well with the 
remaining members of 1933."

As you can note from the change 
of address above, your class cor¬ 
respondent has moved from New 
York to Illinois. On April 14 Ruth 
and I entered this independent¬ 
living retirement community, just 
60- miles south of Chicago, to be 
closer to one of our sons and to 
enjoy the advantages of a pro¬ 
tected environment with health 
and other service amenities for 
our future years. 

When Herb Jacobson, ex-edi¬ 
tor-in-chief of the Columbia Jester, 
was head of a U.N./G.A.T.T. 
institute in Switzerland (1964-81), 
he had to use a pen name on arti¬ 
cles about some of the 50 third- 
world countries to which he was 
carrying out missions. Now he is 
again using his own name on 
occasional contributions to the 
Wall Street Journal and the Miami 
Herald, as well as on a "liberal 
hawk" column in the Tico Times 
of Costa Rica, where he lives on a 
mini-ranch. 

Andrew Khinoy writes from 
Bala Cynwyd, Pa. that as a disas¬ 
ter assistance employee (reservist) 
with FEMA, he served as a public 
officer assisting in the Texas flood 
recovery efforts of 1994. He also 
served in Harrisburg, Pa., Rich¬ 
mond, Va., and Annapolis, Md., 
in connection with the ice storm 
of 1994. He helped produce a 
video on "read-aloud" programs 
for senior adults. Looking for¬ 
ward to the 60th Class Reunion. 

Ed Rickert, class secretary and 
"class mover extraordinaire," is 
now actually recruiting members 
for a committee to plan for our 
60th Reunion on campus, sched¬ 
uled for the week of Memorial 
Day, May 1996. Please reserve the 
time for this great event of 60 
years—really amazing for us.

CLASS NOTES 


Columbia College Today 


days, I heard from four or five 
classmates wanting to attend. So 
I've arranged a gala '37 lunch at 
Sardi's for Tuesday, July 18. Vince 
Sardi's world-famous restaurant is 
at 234 W. 44 St., N.Y.C. Write or 
phone me (718-465-6273) if you 
expect to be there, so that we can 
make suitable arrangements. 

I saw John Leslie, Bob 
Fondiller, Irv Gold, and Herb 
Silverman at Dean's Day, which 
honored Columbia's Core Curri¬ 
culum. Although that term was 
unknown in our school days, we 
all knew CC, which became the 
core of the Core. 

Fondiller reports he just signed 
a contract with the Russian gov¬ 
ernment to build a billion-dollar 
International Trade Center in cen¬ 
tral Moscow, and Leslie recently 
attended the 50th reunion of his 
navy ship, which fought at Oki¬ 
nawa. 

Arizona is a great place to retire, 
but the classmates I saw there 
are aU keeping busy. Dr. Stanley 
Glickman still practices and 
teaches in Tucson, Fred Salinger is 
succoring the wounded Democra¬ 
tic Party in Sierra Vista, and Duke 
Marchese helps with the science 
program in a local, largely His¬ 
panic high school. 

I've also heard from Winston 
Hart and Carl Desch. Winston is 
enjoying anniversaries and fam¬ 
ily reunions. Carl, retired from 
Citibank, serves on some boards 
and travels a lot. 

I'm saddened to report the 
passing of Henry R. Lieberman, 
a good friend in college days. For 
some reason. I've remembered 
for 60 years that the first time I 
ever saw a box of Kleenex was in 
Hank's room in John Jay. A Spec¬ 
tator editor, Lieberman had a 
long and distinguished career 
with The New York Times, and, 
along with his family and much 
of the world, '37 will miss him.

Lawson Bernstein—^who finished 
his term as Class President on June 
3 and was succeeded by Hector 
Dowd—received word in early 
April from Nick Lubar '73 of the 
passing of Nick's father. Bob Lubar, 
after a history of Parkinson's dis¬ 
ease. Hector, Mel Intner, Lester 
Bernstein and Lawson attended a 
memorial service at the University 
Club, which was attended by many 
of Bob's former colleagues at For¬ 
tune and Time magazines. Bob's life¬ 
long friend Nick Stevenson spoke, 
along with Bob's three sons. Bob 
was a graduate of the School of 
Journalism as weU as the College, 
which he staunchly and generously 
supported over the years. Lawson 
has expressed his condolences to 
Bob's family on behalf of the Class. 

Soon after that, Dolores 
Kennedy, wife of Col. Regis 
Kennedy (AUS, ret.), wrote that 
Rege had passed away on March 
15, and had been buried on March 
22 at Arlington National Cemetery 
with full military honors. Lawson, 
who visits Washington, D.C. with 
some regularity, will visit the 
grave there and pay respects to 
Regis on behalf of our class. 

Our new executive vice presi¬ 
dent, Russ Tandy, was unable to 
attend the 55th Reunion because 
he is required to undergo long¬ 
term physical rehabilitation. 
Those of the Class who wish to 
be in touch with Russ can write 
to him at Health South, Treasure 
Coast Rehabilitation Hospital, 


1600 37th St., Vero Beach, Fla.

On the brighter side, Dan 
Edelman, who has built the 
world's largest privately owned 
public relations firm, has recently 
returned from Vietnam and 
Southeast Asia, where he has 
been setting up new offices of his 
worldwide firm, which employs 
almost 1,000 people. 

Our new Class President, 
Hector Dowd, like Lawson, is 
still actively engaged in the prac¬ 
tice of law in New York City. Hec¬ 
tor, you may recall, pitched for 
Columbia at the first televised 
baseball game (it was against 
Princeton). He is past president of 
the Varsity "C" Club, and holds 
the Alumni Medal for outstand¬ 
ing service to the University. 

This year's New York City 
Dean's Day program honored the 
75th anniversary of the Core Cur¬ 
riculum with a very powerful 
tribute by Judge Jose Cabranes 
'61. In addition to Lawson, our 
class was represented by Mimi 
and Lester Bernstein, Trudy and 
Harry Kosovsky, Albie Man and 
your correspondent. Sitting in the 
rotunda of Low Library at lunch 
with the group was a particularly 
moving experience for me...as I 
recalled staring up at the stacks 
on my first visit there, at age 10 
with my dad. Class of '00. 

Will Feinberg, who was until 
his retirement Chief Judge of the 
Second Circuit of the U.S. Court 
of Appeals, continues to sit as a 
senior judge. He was appointed 
by Chief Justice Rehnquist as one 
of nine judges on the long-range 
planning committee of the Judi¬ 
cial Conference in 1990. The 
group issued its first report a few 
months ago, with a series of pro¬ 
posals for dealing with the criti¬ 
cally overloaded federal court 
system. 

Herb Kayden continues as pro¬ 
fessor of medicine at NYU, with 
research on genetic disorders of 
lipid metabolism, including a rare 
version which he defined. He 
recently attended a meeting in 
Tunis, where a number of patients 
with this disorder were discov¬ 
ered, and he made recommenda¬ 
tions for the recognition and treat¬ 
ment of the disease. 

Felicitations to George Scharf- 
fenberger, whose daughter, Joan, 
is marrying Wiljan Laarakkers 
this spring. 

The next edition of the Class 
Notes will be devoted in great part 
to a report on the 55th Reunion. 

If you have any additional infor¬ 
mation that you would like to 
share with the Class, please send 
it to your correspondent at the 
above address.

Apologies to Semmes Clarke, 
whose last name this column 
misspelled in the last issue. 

Erom Art Weinstock comes 
word of Hugh H. Bownes, cur¬ 
rently a Senior Judge on the Court 
of Appeals for the Eirst Circuit in 
Boston, while his wife Mary 
teaches at Brandeis University; on 
the weekends they reside in 
Connecticut. Also from Art is news 
of Levi Smith, recently honored by 
the Syracuse, N.Y. Post-Standard 
with one of its community service 
achievement awards. The news¬ 
paper praised the "assistant dean 
at Syracuse University, who is 
Central New York's premier par¬ 
ticipant-observer. He created the 
Onondaga Citizens League, which 
not only studies local problems but 
proposes effective solutions that 
frequently are adopted. He also 
has founded and presided for a 
quarter-century over the unique 
Thursday Morning Roundtable, 
where a full house of community 
leaders starts one busy day each 
week with a provocative or inspi¬ 
rational program." In addition, a 
scholarship for part-time study at 
S)n-acuse University has been 
named for him. 

Also recently honored was Ted 
de Bary, who received the Erank 
Tannenbaum Memorial Award from 
the University Seminars. During 
1994, Ted visited Aspen, Boston, 
BuckneU, China, Hawaii, Japan, 
Korea, Kansas, California and Wash¬ 
ington, D.C. In between, he taught 
some courses at Columbia. P.S. He is 
allegedly retired! 

Other travel notes: Herb Spisel- 
man and Judy Sagan are off to 
Great Britain to participate in cele¬ 
brations commemorating the 50th 
anniversary of the end of W.W. II. 
Cynthia and Art Friedman have 
gone to California to visit their 
triplet grandchildren. Rhoda and 
Dick Greenwald are also off to 
that state, but to a different desti¬ 
nation. Ruth and Stan Gotliffe 
will be cruising to Bermuda to cel¬ 
ebrate their 50th wedding anniver¬ 
sary, taking children and grand¬ 
children along. 

It is with regret that we note 
the passing of two classmates: 
Duane H. D. Roller of Norman, 
Okla. on August 22,1994, and 
Edward J. Malloy of Selinsgrove, 
Pa. on March 22,1995. Our deep¬ 
est sympathy is extended to their 
families. 

In conclusion, there is a note 
from Ed Amontree, who attended 
a reception in Tampa, Fla. for 
President Rupp and met Bill 
Trenn there. Also, a note from 
Tom Gilliam renainiscing about 
his days (and nights) in Hartley.

Some of you may have wondered 
what happened to our Class Notes 
in the last issue of CCT. So did I. 

I had written a long piece about 
our turn-out at Homecoming, 
with names and news. Well, CCT 
and I finally agreed to blame the 
omission on fax failure and to 
make up for it in these notes. 

Among the regulars at Home¬ 
coming, many with wives and 
other family members, were Presi¬ 
dent Vic Zaro (of course), George 
Froehlich, Bill Carey (with 12 
members of his family), George 
Minervini, Jerry Klingon, Jerry 
Bishop, Gerry Green, Clarence 
Eich, A1 Daniele, Fred Kiachif, 
Bob Kaufman, Len Garth, Jack 
Arbolino, Art Albohn, Tom 
Farkas, Gene Schmitt, Manny 
Lichtenstein, George Hyman, 
Seymour Halpem and myself. 
Coming from California were Joe 
McKinley and Paul Moriarty; 
from Rhode Island, Mel Her- 
shkowitz; and from upstate New 
York, Art Wellington. I'll try to get 
more details in the class newsletter. 

An achievement to be proud of: 
At our 50th Reunion, the goal for 
our class gift was set at $1.5 mil¬ 
lion. Now we have the good news 
that the total amount pledged 
passed $1,454,000 and may well 
pass $1.5M as gifts keep coming in. 

It's no surprise that classmates 
have been active in their local 
alumni clubs. Sandy Black has 
been president of the Columbia 
Club of Southwest Florida, where 
Hank McMaster and Paul Hauck 
have joined him in spreading the 
word about Columbia to local 
high school students. Art Gra¬ 
ham is similarly a leader of the 
Westchester Alumni Club; they 
have brought some of the stars of 
the faculty, as well as President 
Rupp, to well-attended meetings. 

Now for a pair of radiologists: 
While Maury Goodgold remains 
in full-time practice in New York 
City, A1 Rayle writes from 
Atlanta that he is partially retired 
but still spends time doing con¬ 
sultation work. 

Don Mankiewicz is also busy, 
having just completed a script for 
the TV series The Marshal on 
ABC. Don also teaches a course 
in the history of screenwriting at 
the University of Southern Cali¬ 
fornia. An experienced screen¬ 
writer himself and the son and 
nephew of award-winning 
screenwriters (Herman '17 and 
Joseph '28), Don brings a special 
perspective to his students. 

Bob Kaufman, Mel Her- 
shkowitz and I were once room¬ 
mates in Livingston Hall. Over 
the years, the three of us were 


rarely able to get together 
socially. Now, in retirement and 
with nothing in the way, we are 
making up for lost time. 

Finally, also fully retired from 
medicine. Bill Robbins and wife 
Dagny have left Westchester and 
joined the movement to Florida, 
where they can devote them¬ 
selves to bird watching and plant 
study.

A very welcome and newsy note 
from Joe Kelly arrived just in 
time to beat the CCT deadline. "In 
the process of downsizing a house 
full of art, furniture, and other 
assorted artifacts," writes Joe, "I 
found myself very reluctant to 
part with the handsome relief 
print of John Jay, one of a limited 
edition presented to John Jay 
Associates back in 1973. The art 
was the work of and donated by 
'43's artist-in-residence—and 
occasional balladeer—Stan Wyatt. 

"My downsizing dilemma was 
resolved after a visit to the John 
Jay estate, a historic site in Bed¬ 
ford, N.Y. The curator inspected 
the print carefully before telling 
me that it would make an impor¬ 
tant addition to the Jay collection 
and would be hung in a recently 
renovated gallery. 

"For New York area alumni 
the trip to Bedford would be very 
worthwhile. Interestingly, the 
land was acquired by John Jay's 
maternal grandfather, Jacobius 
Van Courtland, in 1703 from the 
Indian sachem Katonah (with 
apparently no help from the 
Nacoms). 

"As this is the 250th anniver¬ 
sary of John Jay's birth, there are 
many historical programs in the 
works, including commemora¬ 
tions of Jay's service as chief jus¬ 
tice during Washington's presi¬ 
dency, his stints as ambassador to 
Spain and governor of New York, 
and his student days at King's 
College. 

"I can also report that Dean's 
Day was most rewarding. The 
lectures were outstanding and 
lunch with Stan Drachman, Joe 
Catalbiano and Lincoln Diamant 
was pleasant. All three are busily 
retired or semi-retired." 

An addendum from your core¬ 
spondent: Through these many 
years Stan Wyatt has been gener¬ 
ous with his talents where Colum¬ 
bia is concerned. He recently told 
me that he gets particular satisfac¬ 
tion from having done the Jay 
portrait and the bronze relief lion 
figure that resides in a niche in 
Butler Library.

Herbert Hendin makes the 
case against Kevorkian 

Herbert Hendin '45, a New York psychiatrist, is executive director of 
the American Suicide Foundation, which is devoted to preventing 
suicide through research and education. In this capacity. Dr. Hendin 
has emerged as a leading critic of efforts to legalize assisted suicide, 
arguing instead for a national commission to inform the medical pro¬ 
fession and the public of the larger issue of caring for the terminally 
ill. "By rushing to 'normalize' euthanasia as a medical option along 
with accepting or refusing treatment," he warns, "we are inevitably 
laying the groundwork for a culture that will not only turn euthana¬ 
sia into a 'cure' for depression but may prove to exert a coercion to 
die on patients when they are most vulnerable. Death ought to be 
hard to sell." Dr. Hendin characterizes the practice of noted "suicide 
doctor" Jack Kevorkian as "reprehensible, bordering on criminal. 

He's putting to death people he hardly knows." 

Dr. Hendin, a graduate of New York University School of Medicine, 
has since 1978 been Professor of Psychiatry at New York Medical Col¬ 
lege; for 18 years previously he was with Columbia's department of 
psychiatry and on the faculty of the University's Psychoanlaytic Cen¬ 
ter. He has conducted investigative studies of suicide, drug abuse, and 
traumatic stress for many leading institutes and hospitals and is the 
author or co-author of some 70 articles and books. A former varsity 
tennis player. Dr. Hendin is actively involved in efforts on behalf of 
the Columbia Tennis Center. His wife, Josephine, recently became chair 
of the English Department at NYU; they have two sons, Neil and Erik.

emeritus at Pepperdine University, 
Malibu, Calif., is the author of a 
soon-to-be-published book, Eife, 
Death, and the Law: A Sourcebook on 
Autonomy and Responsibility in 
Medical Ethics. The product of 
seven years' work, the volume is 
said to constitute the first and only 
comprehensive work to be pub¬ 
lished in this field of law. It is 
described as a synthesized and 
documented rational approach to 
contraception, sterilization, artifi¬ 
cial fertilization, surrogate mother¬ 
ing, abortion, and a host of other 
subjects in this complex field. 

Another author is Charles Cole, 
who is retired and living in Col¬

University of Kentucky in 1994." 

A lovely tea was held in the 
Burden Room of Low Library on 
April 27 to celebrate the establish¬ 


ment of the John K. Mladinov 
Memorial Fund to support stu¬ 
dents who are in the combined 
3-2 plan between the College and 
Engineering School. Carrie Sturts 
from Idaho and Tyler McMaster 
from Montana (both C'96, E'97) 
are the first recipients of the 
scholarship. In attendance at the 
tea were Mrs. Barbara Mladinov, 
John's wife; daughters Ann and 
Mary; the two scholarship recipi¬ 
ents; Bob Schubert; Jim McMe- 
namin, Leslee Fetner and Steve 
Wallace representing the College

Gifts to the scholarship fund are 
still coming in and encouraged, 
and will be greatly appreciated.

Wonders of wonders, your Class 
Secretary finally got some mail 
from classmates. Arthur Haut 
reports from Little Rock, where 
he is professor of internal medi¬ 
cine at the University of Ark¬ 
ansas for Medical Sciences. He is 
also working at the Arkansas 
Cancer Research Center. His 
wife, Florence, founded Potluck 
Inc., a non-profit food recovery 
and distribution program for the 
hungry. Two children are clinical 
psychologists (one at Rush-Pres- 
byterian Hospital in Chicago and 
the other at the University of 
West Virginia in Morgantown)— 
a third is a pediatrician in fellow¬ 
ship at Children's Hospital, also 
in Chicago; the youngest child is 
a senior publicist at a major pub¬ 
lishing company in N.Y.C. Art says 
there is no alumni club in Little 
Rock but he does see Norman Hol¬ 
comb '50 and Gus Falk '52. (Give 
them my best. Art.) 

Neil Wald writes from Pitts¬ 
burgh, where he is professor of 
environmental and occupational 
health and also professor of 
human genetics at the Graduate 
School of Health at the Univer¬ 
sity of Pittsburgh. Neil says that 
in spite of all the confusion of the 
war years, when diplomas and 
graduation dates were thor¬ 
oughly mixed up, he is still look¬ 
ing forward to the 50th Reunion 
in 1996. (We'll see you there at 
Arden House, Neil.) 

A wonderful letter came from 
Jake Israel, who refuses to be out¬ 
done by our historian, Fritz Stem, 
who makes all these columns. Jake 
states that he is still alive and 
working as an anesthesiologist. He 
left Columbia in '46 and spent 
time in the Navy during the 
Korean war after graduating from 
medical school. He also spent his 
65th birthday at Portsmouth Naval 
Hospital on active duty during 
Desert Storm. He worked in S 3 n'a- 
cuse for 20+ years, then came to 
Columbia Presbyterian and then to 
his present job at North Central 
Bronx Hospital, which is part of 
Montefiore Hospital and The 
Albert Einstein College of Medi¬ 
cine. There he does clinical anes¬ 
thesia, trains residents and teaches 
medical students. He has written a 
number of articles and fathered a 
book or two—not best sellers. Of 
his three children: one son was 
Columbia '74 and is now a physi¬ 


cian at NYU College of Medicine; 
one daughter was Barnard '75 and 
is now in L.A. working towards a 
law degree; one son got away and 
went to SjTacuse and then NYU 
grad school. 

The usual communication 
came in from Howard Clifford, 
who now resides at Pepper Mill, 
Utah, where I understand he has 
been supporting himself as a 
pretzel-dipper in the Great Salt 
Lake. Howard says, do not 
laugh—it takes talent to get just 
the right flavoring. Howard com¬ 
mented to me on an article in The 
New York Times about our class¬ 
mate Ira Millstein, who received 
a John Jay Award from the Col¬ 
lege in March. Howard is still 
trying to get Ira interested in 
some of his enterprises but fig¬ 
ures he will have to wait until 
the 50th to see Ira in person. 
Bemie Sunshine, who repre¬ 
sented the Class at the dinner, 
told me that Ira did us proud. 

Keep those letters and cards 
coming in.

On rare occasions, a cri de coeur is 
answered, even one from your 
Class Notes correspondent. Two 
years to go to the big anniversary 
(when answers to questionnaires 
can overload this column), yet 
the postman has rung six times 
since the last issue of this journal. 

Ted Smith reports from New 
Hampshire that he is manning a 
lonely outpost, surrounded by 
alumni of "the Big Green," hold¬ 
ing out until our football team 
comes to the rescue. Meanwhile, 
"family, retirement and health 
doing fine [but] golf score 
increasing with age." 

The rest of the mail is, by felic¬ 
itous coincidence, entirely from 
the literati among our classmates. 
In alphabetical order (we play no 
favorites), we first have a note 
from Dan Hoffman reporting 
that his ninth (yes, ninth) book of 
poems. Middens of the Tribe, will 
be published this June. 

Russian Thought after Com¬ 
munism is the title of a volume of 
essays published last year, dedi¬ 
cated to George Kline, professor 
emeritus of philosophy at Bryn 
Mawr, containing an overview of 
his 40 years of contributions to 
the study of Russian philosophy. 
Bob Pease, author of five books 
of poems and short stories, 
announces that he has written a 
novel entitled O.U.I. (Operating 
Under the Influence), noting that 
it "is fiction, not a case history 
and not a personal experience." 
The novel was self-published and 
is available from Bob, himself. 


Last, but hardly least, my table- 
tennis opponent of eons past, 

Dick Sterne, professor of English 
at Simmons College, advises that 
his work. Dark Mirror: The Sense of 
Injustice in Modern European and 
American Literature, has been nom¬ 
inated by the publisher, Fordham 
University Press, for the James 
Russell Lowell Prize of the Mod¬ 
ern Language Association. We 
hope the next issue can report its 
election. 

Keep up the good work, fellas, 
and your correspondent will 
never whine in print again.

remember when.

Saw the usual suspects at lunch 
on Dean's Day, all looking well 
and enjoying their manifold 
activities. In attendance were 
George Cook, Ruth and Bill 
Lubic, Naomi and Marvin Lip- 
man, Ruth and Art Feder, Gene 
Hawes, Dick Kandel, and your 
correspondent. As we were at 
two widely separated tables 
someone may have been missed, 
for which I apologize. 

Russell Sherman opened Miller 
Theater's season last (Dctober as 
soloist in an all-Beethoven pro¬ 
gram at the start of a series titled 
"The Composer and the Key¬

performed with leading orchestras 
across the nation as well as in 
major European, South American 
and Canadian cities, and recently 
recorded 12 Beethoven sonatas for 
GM Recordings, Gunther 
Schuller's company. Too bad the 
announcement was not sent to 
'49ers in advance of the event! 

We express our deep sorrow 
at the news of Stan Harwood's 
bereavement in March. His 
beloved wife Debbie fought a long 
and tough fight against severe ill¬ 
ness. And sincere condolences to 
George Brunner, who lost his 
dear wife Ruth to lung cancer 
last July after more than 40 years 
of marriage. To both Stan and 
George, heartfelt wishes that they 
may be comforted by their memo¬ 
ries and have better times ahead.

Hurrah! Heard from more than 
the usual number of classmates 
this time. More work for your cor¬ 
respondent, but it was gratifying. 
Frank Dugan Jr. reports that he 


retired last December as librarian 
of the Masonic Medical Research 
Laboratory in Utica, N.Y. 

Another retiree. Herb Genfan, 
is living in Ithaca, N.Y. Says he 
enjoys "piddling" on the Inter¬

Donell, retired from the Episco¬ 
pal priesthood in January '94. 
Alex and Clare are living in 
Lanoka Harbor, N.J., and he says 
he's "enjoying it thoroughly." 

And yet another, Anthony 
Megna, sold his small tool busi¬ 
ness in Florida. After 40 years, 
Tony writes, he's "looking for¬ 
ward to retirement." 

Des Nunan, who has extolled 
the benefits of triathlons for folks 
our age, reports being in training 
for a competition scheduled for 
May in Ocean City, N.J., where he 
lives. Des attended the Columbia 
crew reunion last fall and, after a 
44-year hiatus, went out for a row 
on the Harlem River. Didn't catch 
any crabs but did raise a few blis¬ 
ters, he says. 

Norman Podhoretz was 
scheduled to step down in May 
from his 35-year term as editor in 
chief of Commentary magazine. 
Norm reportedly will continue 
writing for Commentary and other 
publications and intends writing 
the third volume of an autobio¬ 
graphical trilogy. The first two 
volumes were Making It, pub¬ 
lished in 1968, and Breaking 
Ranks, published in 1979. 

Dudley Rochester has retired 
as head of the division of pul¬ 
monary and critical care medi¬

ley is also active as a volunteer 
with the American Lung Associa¬ 
tion of Virginia. 

Bob Russell checked in just 
long enough to say "hello," so 
we report his greeting. Good to 
hear from you. Bob! 

And on a sad note: We report 
the death earlier this year of 
Eugene Hallahan. Since gradua¬ 
tion Gene had been active in his

Who is not retired? H. Elliot 
Wales is still practicing law in 
New York City. He and Fran 
have 2 8/9 grandchildren! Elliot 
writes articles, is active in several 
bar associations and enjoys trav¬ 
eling in the West when he can get 
away. Paul Wallace is a practic¬

12 years at hazard Freres & Co., 
where he was a general partner. 
(Bessemer manages more than $9 
billion in assets, mainly for indi¬ 
vidual clients.) Stan recently 
received the distinguished service 
award from Wyoming Seminary 
in Pennsylvania, where he was a 
1948 graduate. 

Now that Max Frankel has 
"retired," he writes a column, 
"Word & Image," for The New

One of our most popular class¬ 
mates, Whitey Brandt, passed 
away on January 14, after a long 
battle with diabetes. Claudia 
reports that even during his last 
weeks at home, Whitey still had 
a "full shock of hair," "looked 
great," and "lived life to the 
fullest." The couple had been 
happily married for 35 years, and 
have two children, Andrea and 
Paul. Whitey was one of the 
founders of the American Feed 
and Livestock Co., which pro¬ 
duces a milk-substitute formula 
that is fed to calves. More than 
likely, the calf who provides the 
tender pieces of tasty veal you 
eat in New York City was raised 
on Whitey's formula! 

Ever since graduation. Laddie 
Perenyi has been lost. All Colum¬ 
bia mail was returned to sender 
with "no forwarding address" 
stamped on the envelope. The 
only organization that seemed to 
be able to locate Laddie was the 
IRS, and they wouldn't pass his 
latest address to anyone else. 
Fortunately, after 37 years. Lad¬ 
die mailed a card to CCT reveal¬ 
ing that he now lives with Ann in 
Fullerton, Calif. I phoned Laddie 
and can report that he is an inter¬ 
national management trou¬ 
bleshooter for a major company 
involved in the development and 
production of high-tech instru¬ 
ments. Over the years. Laddie 
and Ann have lived in Switzer¬ 


land, Singapore, China, Fiong 
Kong and Germany. He's still 
energetic, active, and having fun 
traveling the world for his com¬ 
pany. Laddie reports being enam¬ 
ored of growing orchids in Cali¬ 
fornia and would appreciate 
receiving some of the special 
manure Rolon Reed has been 
shoveling in Florida. They have 
one son and a grandson named 
Laddie Perenyi. 

Phil Wilson writes that he 
retired in May 1993 as the head 
of strategic planning for the 
Moore Corporation and is living 
in East Amherst, N.Y. Phil claims 
that he has raised the art of pro¬ 
crastination to a new level. Nev¬ 
ertheless, Phil is now working to 
develop and distribute "old can¬ 
dies in new packages." One of 
his creations is a candy called 
"Buffalo Blocks," which he indi¬ 
cates is a honeycomb covered 
with chocolate. Phil married his 
college sweetheart, Mary, and 
they are enjoying watching their 
son Peter '86 become a "portfolio 
bond manager for Montgomery 
Securities." 

Harold Abrams writes that he 
has been in practice of general 
surgery in Fairfield, Conn. 

Harold continues to remain 
young. As a matter of fact, his 
youngest daughter, Christine, is 
about to enter high school. 

Harold has two older daughters, 
Lorrie Sisti and Sharon, and two 
grandchildren. He is remarried to 
Carol Johnson Abrams. 

Joel Danziger is another young 
member of the Class of '53. There 
is a 16-year space between their 
oldest and youngest children. As 
a matter of fact, Joel's and Joan's 
youngest daughter, Sarah, is in 
her third year at Andover. Joel 
reports that he has been practic¬ 
ing law in White Plains with the 
firm of Danziger and Markoff for 
35 years. The firm has 12 lawyers 
including his son Robert. Son 
Marc is a physician. 

Arthur Elkind has been 
appointed medical director of 
Mount Vernon (N.Y.) Hospital. He 
is also the vice president of the 
National Headache Foundation 
and has written a book called 
Handbook of Headache Disorders. 

Allan Jackman had a big 
reunion in Washington in May 
1994 with David Richman, Barry 
Schweid, Don Hymes, and A1 
Arking. According to Allan, the 
party was organized by Dave 
Richman. In the next issue of 
CCT, I'll let you know whether 
Dave is willing to organize 
reunions for every classmate 
who visits Washington! 

A1 Huber writes that he has 
retired from active teaching, and 
is now a full-time practicing 
allergist. A1 reports that he and 


Jeanne also raise sheep and 
maintain a large garden.

During the past couple of 
months, we have lost two mem¬ 
bers of our class who, in keeping 
with Columbia College tradi¬ 
tions, made real contributions to 
their communities. 

In La Jolla, Calif., Bob Watkins 
died of a coronary. Bob was 
director, international marketing, 
at Hardy Instruments. Bob's 
career enabled him to make 
major contributions in both 
nuclear chemistry and market¬ 
ing. He served for 13 years on 
the board of directors of the 
World Trade Association of San 
Diego. Bob and his wife Joan 
authored several articles, as well 
as a popular travel book. The 
World Travel Planner. He and his 
family requested that contribu¬ 
tions in his name be made to the 
Columbia College Fund. 

We were also saddened to hear 
of the loss of Dale Hopp. Many 
of us remember Dale as a bright, 
soft-spoken member of the foot¬ 
ball team, who was voted the 
most outstanding player for 1953. 
Dale and his family lived in 
Greenwich, Conn., and he prac¬ 
ticed dentistry in New York City; 
he was a past president of the 
New York Academy of Dentistry. 

I always looked forward to see¬ 
ing Dale at alumni events. Both 
Dale and Bob will be missed by 
family and friends. 

On a brighter note. Jack 
McDermott and his wife Polly 
have retired to Hilton Head, S.C. 
Jack was with Golf Digest for 
many years and I understand that 
even now, in retirement, he is 
responsible for putting together 
the programs of the Masters 
Tournament in Augusta, Ga. Well, 
Jack was great as editor of Jester, 
and I remember his first byline in 
Life magazine shortly after we 
were graduated, on a baseball 
rookie whose name, I believe, 
was Dave Columbia. 

Scott Glover has joined the 
ranks of the retirees (in his case, 
from Exxon) and is now living in 
Punta Gorda, Fla., where he is 
enjoying tennis, sailing, and "the 
climate." In the fray of things, we 
hear that Dr. Andy Biache is 
working hard (and enjoying it) in 
Alexandria, Va. as senior v.p. of 
Autometric, Inc., an R&D firm 
specializing in the exploitation of 
earth observation, remote sens¬ 
ing, reconnaissance, and map¬ 
ping systems. Josh Greenberg 
reports that he is now a trustee of 
the Robert Mapplethorpe AIDS 
Treatment Facility. 


Norman Kahn, a professor of 
Pharmacology at both P&S and the 
Robinson School of Dental and 
Oral Surgery, is also serving this 
academic year as Dean of the 
School of Dental and Oral Surgery 
at Columbia. Finally (for this issue), 
if anyone wants to "tie the knot" in 
the State of Connecticut, I'd be 
happy to help since I am now a 
Justice of the Peace. 

Please let me hear from and 
about you.

As our 40th Reunion came upon 
us, one could see the Columbia 
campus filled with a bevy of 
activity—there were many con¬ 
struction projects underway and 
others in the planning stage. The 
priorities of the University 
administration are the libraries, 
Ferris Booth Hall (which will be 
torn down and then rebuilt), and 
the Dodge Physical Fitness Cen¬ 
ter, which is bulging at the 
proverbial seams with all sorts of 
athletic endeavors. 

Leading up to our Reunion 
were several key events. Among 
those were the special lecture by 
Prof. Jim Shenton '49, given to 
over 40 people at the West End 
Gate (nee West End Bar), and the 
cocktail reception Jim Phelan 
hosted for over 60 people at his 
home in Manhattan, where we 
espied notables such as Dick 
Ascher, Barry Sullivan, Bob 
Schiff, Paul Frank and many oth¬ 
ers; Dean's Day, where the class 
continued to have the highest 
attendance of any class, including 
Ben Kaplan and Nick Moore. 

The "silent generation"? Never! 

A reunion tends to bring out 
little-known news about our 
classmates, some of whom have 
re-surfaced after all these years. 
Martin Salan has been quite 
active in the San Francisco area 
with the Columbia University 
Alumni Club, putting together 
theater parties for club members. 
Joaquin Ramirez is approaching 
retirement after 30 years of med¬ 
ical practice in Chula Vista, Calif. 
The old lightweight crew oars¬ 
man, Gareth Janney, has retired. 
He spends his days looking out 
over the Pacific Ocean from his 
manse in Manhattan Beach. 

Bemie Kirtman came east ear¬ 
lier this year to be at Bill Epstein's 
daughter's nuptials. Bernie just 
stepped down after nine years as 
head of the chemistry department 
at U.C.-Santa Barbara. He remains 
a professor of chemistry at the 
school, however. We also found 
out that Edwin Rodgers, the dou¬ 
ble expatriate (N.Y. to L.A. to 
Louisville), recently became radi-

Munoz is creditor-in-chief 


Carlos R. Munoz '57 has been appointed chief credit officer of The 
Dime Savings Bank of New York after a long career with Citibank, 
which he first joined in 1959 when it was still known as First 
National City Bank. Most recently, he was a senior vice president, 
responsible at various times for credit management and oversight of 
Citibank's worldwide consumer banking activities, as well as private 
banking and global finance in Latin America. 

A native New Yorker who came to Columbia from Stuyvesant High 
School, Mr. Munoz participated in student government and freshman 
basketball in the College; before earning an M.A. in economics at Colum¬ 
bia, he served as an officer in the U.S. Army Reserve. He is now a mem¬ 
ber of the College's Board of Visitors, a benefactor of the John Jay Associ¬ 
ates, and First Vice President of the College Alumni Association. Mr. 
Munoz also serves as a trustee of the Episcopal Diocese of New York and 
a board member of the Inner City Scholarship Fund and the Episcopal 
Mission Society. He enjoys reading, running, and tournament bridge. 

A resident of White Plains, N.Y., Mr. Munoz has two grown chil¬ 
dren—Carla Slaughter, a Harvard graduate now teaching law in 
London, and Kyle, a UCLA grad who works as a project supervisor 
for Xerox—with one grandchild so far, and another due in September.

The migration to the Sun Belt 
has involved many of us. We 
know Don McDonough is living 
in West Palm Beach between voy¬ 
ages to Ireland. Don keeps in 
touch with his buddy, Michael 
Standard, who is an attorney in 
Pound Ridge, N.Y. Charles Miller, 
who was Jules Rosenberg's class¬ 
mate at Forest HUls High School, 
has retired in Maitland, Fla., 
where he too watches the ocean 
from his picture windows.

Berick, of Shaker Heights, Ohio, 
adds that A1 made the highest gift 
in the history of University Hospi¬ 
tals of Cleveland and that there is 
now an Alfred and Norma Lemer 
Tower there. Jim, by the way, is on 
the Columbia College Board of 
Visitors and is a tmstee of the 
Rock-n-RoU Hall of Fame. 

Lew Mendelson let us know he 
has been working in Washington, 
D.C. and has been traveling exten¬ 
sively to the former Soviet Union, 
helping to develop capital markets 
in places like Kyrgyzstan. We 
heard that Manfred Spengler is 
doing fine as a professor of indus¬ 
trial and systems engineering at 
Virginia Polytechnic and State 
University in Blacksburg. Manfred 
will be celebrating his 20th year in 
this part of Virginia. 

Someone who has always been 
a terrific Columbia and Class of 
'55 supporter is Tom Chrystie. 
Tom shuttles back and forth 
between the East Coast and 
Wyoming. He is now moving to 
a newly built home in Jackson 
Hole. Tom's new office is a log 
cabin on his property in Wilson. 
In addition to everything else he 
does, Tom is a trustee for the 
National Museum of Wildlife Art 
in Jackson and is Tmstee Emeri¬ 
tus at Columbia. 

Our classmates continue to 
write and publish on diverse sub¬ 
jects. Gordon Silverman, chair¬ 
man and professor of electrical 
engineering at Manhattan College, 
had his third book published 
recently: FORTRAN 90 & Engineer¬ 
ing Computation. Peter Pressman, 
associate clinical professor of 
surgery at the Albert Einstein Col¬ 
lege of Medicine, has a new book 
entitled Breast Cancer: The Complete 
Guide. The man who made Jester 


an outstanding magazine, Harvey 
Greenberg, is still writing Screen 
Memories (Columbia University 
Press) and practicing psycho¬ 
analysis in Manhattan. 

Richard Bloomenstein has not 
retired. He is doing plastic surgery 
in Teaneck, N.J. with his wife as 
business manager. The distribution 
manager of G. Pappas & Co. is 
Bxurt Doremus. Burt and family 
hve in Bridgeton, N.J., where he is 
chairman of the Hopewell Town¬ 
ship Planning Board. 

A special newsletter wrapping 
up the 40th will be in your hands 
shortly, as will the results of the 
class survey, which had a tremen¬ 
dous response. Let me toast you, 
fellow classmates, who make it 
all possible. Stay well. Continue 
to be yourselves. See you at the 
next event. The 45th is slowly 
looming toward us. 

Love to everyone! Everywhere!

This column opens with a sad 
note, namely the death of A1 
Brody after a long fight with can¬ 
cer. He was my loyal and ever- 
helpful vice president and a man 
of great character. He will be 
sorely missed by myself, his fam¬ 
ily and many friends, including 
Don Morris, who wrote a mar¬ 
velous remembrance which he 
sent to Al's wife, Barbara. 

As I write, our first 40th 
Reunion Committee meeting has 
been tentatively scheduled for June 
7. Lenny Wolfe, who planned to 
attend, said his energy level is so 
high that he has started a new 
design firm in N.Y.C. and his only 
reminder of the passing years 
comes when he looks in the mirror. 
I told him that gray hairs are better 
than none and, anyway, I have the 
reverse problem, with dwindUng 
energy but reasonable mirror inter¬ 
action—^looks have always been 
deceiving. Lou Hemmerdinger, 
who win also attend, recently 
retired after approximately 36 
years at Grumman. That's the way 
it used to be, with long careers at 
one corporation, but such interde¬ 
pendent loyalty is definitely a past- 
tense phenomenon. Lou is also 
starting a new business. Mark 
Novick, who was so valuable to 
our 35th Reunion, will also join us, 
and calls are in to other 35th com¬ 
mittee members, like Steve Easton, 
Larry Gitten, Stan Soren, Nick 
Coch, Mike Spett, Danny Link, 
Don Morris, et al. Please contact 
me if you are interested, as I am 
always in need of help, something 
my wife has been emphasizing for 
years. 

I have also heard from Len 


Bram, who has another grand¬ 
child. Roy Russo writes he is 
president of the Columbia Club 
of Washington, D.C. and that 
Joshua Hollander has the same 
title in Rochester, N.Y. Maybe we 
should adopt the idea we toyed 
with at the 35th planning ses¬ 
sions and have area chairmen to 
get the maturing bodies of our 
loyal classmates in for the 40th. 
What do you think? Al Broadwin 
writes that he too has set up a 
new consulting company deahng 
with corporate quality systems. 
One of our better-known class¬ 
mates, on or off the basketball 
court, Franklin Thomas, is step¬ 
ping down after 16 years as pres¬ 
ident of the Ford Foundation. 
Frank, maybe you would like to 
work on our Reunion. 

Incidentally, as of 1995, we have 
met our original goal of four Class 
of 1956 Scholarship recipients and 
wiU need a new goal for long-term 
giving to Columbia College to be 
decided at the 40th. So let's start 
thinking, as Ole Alma Mater is a 
remarkable and deserving institu¬ 
tion which impresses me more 
and more as I continue taking 
evening courses there. 

Well, enough for now and let 
me hear from you guys!

Now we're cooking! Jean-Louis 
R. Audette de La Pointe has 
finally reappeared in a short, 
somewhat cryptic note that 
makes me regret all the time I've 
spent with classmates who were 
merely doctors and lawyers. J.-L. 
has recently retired as "managing 
director of a Swiss-German 
industrial company specializing 
in state-of-the-art cooking uten¬ 
sils used in most or all the French 
three-star Michelin-rated restau¬ 
rants." Can you imagine his life, 
eating through Europe checking 
up on high-tech forks and 
spoons? Why did he retire? To do 
what? I don't remember J.-L., 
although the intense, thin-faced 
young man in our freshman 
yearbook recalled Jean-Paul Bel¬ 
mondo. Audette did not appear 
in our senior book, and in subse¬ 
quent reunion directories he was 
always listed with "lost class¬ 
mates." Well, Jean-Louis is lost 
no more, trolled in by this hot 
column. He is living near Stras¬ 
bourg, France, and plans to visit

Seven days and 279 miles. I hope 
he pulled his weight. Remember, 
A1 was on the varsity lightweight

As of CCT's deadline, your corre¬

copies of the extensive question¬ 
naire sent out for the 35th Reunion 
(past history by the time you read 
this). More on that later, but early 
responses bring news that Irving 
Chang was about to attend his 
second Columbia College gradua¬ 
tion as a parent, alas both too close 
and too distant to consider staying 
for the reunion. Stewart E. Reuter 
also reports a conflict, as he was to 
attend a convention of the Navy 
League of the United States, a vol¬ 
unteer civilian organization of 
which he is national director, 
national committeeman and 
national assistant treasurer. 

Lloyd Moglen, whose skills 
helped establish tennis excellence 
at Columbia in our days, still 
plays but "doesn't run as fast." 
He's an M.D. and informs us that 
both children have now gradu¬ 
ated from (urmamed) college. No 
information on place of residence, 
but he does provide a number, 
(800) 788-8338, and an invitation 
to call and "catch up." 

Your correspondent observes

title from Peter's handwritten 
note and hopes it is approxi¬ 
mately correct (quick research at 
Brentano's only turned up the 
short title). 

Finally, your reporter is 
pleased to announce the opening 
of the Dahesh Museum, located 
conveniently at Fifth Avenue 
near 48th St. (i.e., not far from 
Columbia's 19th-century campus, 
now the site of much corporate 
activity and such seasonal treats 
as a famous Christmas tree and a 
skating rink). As founding direc¬ 
tor, I was given the task of start¬ 
ing an art museum in New York 
from the ground up. Rotating 
special exhibitions will concen¬ 
trate on the strength of the collec¬ 
tion, European academic art of 
the 19th and 20th centuries. The 
summer exhibition, which runs 
through most of September, will 
look at artistic interpretations of 
rural life at a time of rapid (and 
rather messy) urbanization. If 
you do visit, please announce 
yourself to the director, who is 
usually on site and who would 
like to have class news delivered 
in such a personal way.

Five hours of sleep got him 
15 minutes of fame 


S tudents fall asleep 

in class. John Giorno 
'58 fell asleep on 
camera. A familiar 
figure in the New 
York arts world, Mr. 
Giorno may be best known—if 
not immediately recognizable— 
for a singular act he performed 
more than 30 years ago: starring 
in Andy Warhol's first experi¬ 
mental movie. Sleep. 

Acclaimed as visually arrest¬ 
ing modern art 
by some, sav¬ 
aged as point¬ 
less avant-garde 
claptrap by oth¬ 
ers, the work lit¬ 
erally depicted 
nothing but Mr. 

Giorno in vari¬ 
ous stages of 
sleep for five 
hours and 21 
minutes. 

Recently, Sleep 
was restored 
from its original 
negative for a 
Warhol retro¬ 
spective at the 
Whitney 
Museum, with a 
consequent 
reawakening of 
its notoriety. 

Mr. Giorno, a 
poet/stockbro¬ 
ker who fell in 
with Mr. Warhol 
in the early 
1960's, recalled 
the genesis of 
Sleep in his new 
book You Got To 
Burn To Shine: "I 
loved to sleep. I 
slept all the 
time, twelve 
hours a day. It 
was the only 
place that felt 
good: complete 
oblivion, resting 
in a warm dream world, taking 
refuge in the lower realms." 

Over Memorial Day week¬ 
end 1963, a speed-laden Andy 
Warhol stayed up all night, fas¬ 
cinated, as he watched Mr. 
Giorno deep in Morpheus's 
embrace following a bout with 
140-proof rum. Mr. Warhol 
exclaimed, "7 want to make a 
movie of you sleeping!" Mr. 


Giorno responded, "I want to 
be a movie star! I want to be like 
Marilyn Monroe!" (Mr. Giorno's 
italics.) 

And so Sleep was shot in Mr. 
Giorno's apartment that sum¬ 
mer: Mr. Warhol would set up 
his camera while his subject 
imdressed and indulged in a 
vodka nightcap. "Two minutes 
after my head hit the pillow, I 
was asleep. When I woke up the 
next morning, Andy would be 
gone, the house lights still on. 


and the floor littered with scraps 
of film and empty yellow boxes." 
Mr. Warhol ultimately shot thou¬ 
sands of rolls of footage, which 
he found himself unable to cob¬ 
ble together into a coherent 
whole. Finally he yelled, "We 
should just use anything!" 

The finished film, consisting 
of often repeated glimpses of 
Mr. Giorno's prostrate form 


seen from a multitude of angles, 
premiered at the Gramercy Arts 
Theatre on January 17,1964. 
Only nine people showed up, 
two of whom left in the first 
hour. The movie's long-running 
infamy had begun. 

Today, portions of Sleep are 
shown periodically at the Andy 
Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, 
where a silk-screened plexiglass 
sculpture depicting two of its 16 
mm images is also on display. 

For Mr. Giorno, who is now a 

performing poet, 
founder of the 
AIDS Treatment 
Project, and still a 
champion sleeper 
("Sleep is won¬ 
derful, the best 
thing about liv¬ 
ing"), accepting 
his on-screen 
appearance has 
been a slow 
process. In 1987, 
after not having 
seen the film for 
more than 15 
years, he caught 
a 40-minute 
excerpt. "It was 
embarrassing, 
like looking at 
baby pictures of 
you before you 
lost your baby 
fat. I was a big 
baby and a big 
piece of meat." 

But he has 
warmed to the 
newly restored 
print. "It was 
actually star¬ 
tling," he told 
CCT. "It looked 
Uke a Cartier- 
Bresson photo¬ 
graph, in aU of 
the richness of 
black and white. 

It was really 
beautiful, like a 
moving photograph." 

For the record, Mr. Giorno 
has yet to sit through an entire 
showing of his famous movie. 
He hasn't even slept through it.

Barry Shapiro writes from Sil¬

title of oldest first-time father to 
one of my classmates, but not the 
title of youngest retiree until 
proven undeserving. After 25 
years of federal service, I am now 
embarked on a new career (I 
hope) in labor-management rela¬ 
tions: arbitration mediation teach¬

From University Park, Pa., we 
learn that Bruce Trinkley is cele¬ 
brating 25 years of teaching at 
Penn State and directing the 
Penn State Glee Club. A sabbati¬ 
cal last year took him to artists' 
colonies in Virginia, New Mexico, 
California, and Wyoming. He 
also did a three-week stint in 






Wales visiting those sonorous 
Welsh male choirs (along with 
making his Welsh conducting 
debut at St. David's Hall in 
Cardiff). Bruce is currently con¬ 
ducting a massive choral sym¬ 
phony commissioned by State 
College (the home of Penn State). 
His cantata, Santa Rosalia, based 
on one of the nun paintings of 
Fernando Botero, with text by his 
partner Jason Charnesky, will be 
filmed this summer for PBS 
broadcast during the next year. 
He would like John Litvack to 
know that Feathertop (the 1967 
Columbia Varsity Show) is hav¬ 
ing another life as an orchestral 
suite and had performances by 
the Penn State Chamber Orches¬ 
tra in Vienna, Prague, Stuttgart 
and Munich in May of last year. 

Having spent most of his 
working life in various art man¬ 
agement positions, including a 
decade at the Cultural Affairs 
Department of the City of New 
York, Randall Bourscheidt was 
recently named by Mayor 
Rudolph Giuliani to the position 
of chairman of the New York 
City Advisory Commission for 
Cultural Affairs. This honorary 
appointment is in recognition of 
Randall's extensive work in pro¬ 
moting public support for the 
arts, including research into the 
economic impact of the arts. This 
work has primarily been done in 
his present capacity as president 
of the Alliance for the Arts, 
where Randall has published cul¬ 
tural guides to New York City 
and is about to establish a cul¬ 
tural calendar for New York on a 
site of the World Wide Web of the 
Internet. Another undertaking of 
which he is especially proud is 
the Estate Project for Artists with 
AIDS, the first national effort to 
assist artists with life-threatening 
diseases in completing their 
work and planning their estates. 

From our assiduous contribu¬ 
tor, Joe Cody, we received a New 
York Times clipping about 
Michael Garrett, his wife Sandra, 
and three other couples who 
have met every mid-winter for 
the past 26 years to celebrate 
"Druid New Year," a holiday 
they themselves invented. This 
ritual is part support group for 
inchoate entrepreneurs and part 
feast, and has been held in such 
places as London and St. Lucia. 

Joe also joins his Nu Sigma 
Chi friends. Rich Beggs, Dave 
Felder, Tom McMahan, and Jim 
Larson, in offering condolences 
to Harvey Kurzweil on the tragic 
death of his son, who was a 
sophomore at the College. Joe

Robert Myerson cites doctors' 
reports that his recovery is "pro¬ 
ceeding as well as can be 
expected. Bank examiners beat 
him up pretty badly at his last reg¬ 
ulatory exam for failure to use the 
possessive case before the present 
participle and for one instance of 
lack of agreement between pro¬ 
noun and antecedent—^he tried to 
explain that 'they' is gender-neu¬ 
tral and that having once achieved 
a perfect score on his weekly 
freshman Enghsh grammar quiz, 
he no longer had to worry about 
such matters. Unfortunately, he 
was told that the laws of grammar 
would be strictly enforced. Bob 
figures this is just another good 
reason to continue working on his 
Goumal of Jibberish, and reminds 
all that he is still soliciting articles 
for the next issue written in bad 
faith, by people of bad taste (who 
also happen to have bad breath). 
Preference, as usual, will be given 
to his friends." 

The Penobscot School, in Rock¬ 
land, Maine, was the subject of a 
recent article in Down East maga¬ 
zine. Founded in 1986 by Julia 
Schulz and husband Joe Stein- 
berger, the school is described as 
an innovative center for foreign 
language study. The two-room 
school received Rockland's com¬ 
munity service award in 1991, 
and is credited for bringing the 
world of foreign languages to a 
wide range of local people.

The madwoman (in my neigh¬ 
borhood we have diversity) 
brought one letter and a few 
recycled crumbs from the editors, 
barely enough material for a col¬ 
umn of any import. Nonetheless, 
despite the odds, I again accept 
the challenge (rah, rah?). 

Nigel Paneth, prompted by 
"the emptiness of your [my] last 
column" (is that a dig? For those 
of you who have been out of the 
country, this column has been 
running on empty for years), 
wrote to me (he was the only one; 
as such, he gets top billing. 
Everyone else is simply alphabet¬ 


ical—writer's prerogative) "for 
the first time in some years," with 
much the same news he provided 
the last time. To wit, he and his 
family relocated to East Lansing, 
Mich, six years ago and became 
Spartans in a tandem arrange¬ 
ment when both he and his wife 
accepted academic positions at 
Michigan State University. He 
directs the epidemiology program 
at the College of Human Medi¬ 
cine and she teaches English hter- 
ature to undergraduates. Their 
daughters, now aged 14 and 9, 
are "a source of great joy." 

From the state desk (and my 
own sources)... Bill Henrich, a 
native Texan who probably voted 
for Bush, is now a Buckeye vis-a- 
vis his new position as chairman 
of the department of medicine at 
the Medical College of Ohio, in 
Toledo. Kudos and congrats from 
Cleveland. 

From campus, courtesy of 
CCT, which hopefully received a 
decent donation in return... Glen 
Reeves, based in D.C., is still the 
U.S. government's technical man¬ 
ager for several joint projects 
between the Armed Forces (ours) 
Radiobiology Institute and vari¬ 
ous scientific laboratories in Rus¬ 
sia and some of the former Soviet 
republics. 

Peter Rosegg, after 20 years 
with the Elonolulu Advertiser, is 
now a speechwriter for Ben 
Cayetano, the newly elected gov¬ 
ernor of Hawaii and the first Fil¬ 
ipino-American to hold such a 
high office. 

John Slattery is chief financial 
officer of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen and 
Hamilton in New York, where he 
lives and computes with his wife 
Katherine, a real estate broker with 
Corcoran Group, daughter Kate, 
aged 14, and son James, aged 11. 

That's it for now. If inclined, 
call or write, with news, rumina¬ 
tions, or even rumor, if you'd like 
to be part of the next reportorial 
attempt at fame. 

And remember... keep the 
faith and, if possible, send money 
to either me or to the College 
Fund (your choice).

Even in Philadelphia I still 
read The New York Times every 
day, and have seen two mentions 
of Mark Seiden: One was a 
June 1994 headline—"In E-Mail, 
MIS@seiden.com Is an Elite 
Address"—over an article which 
noted: "But real status belongs 
to those very few people whose 
domain is their last name—a 
direct connection to the Net, the 
closest anyone can get. Mark 
Seiden, a computer consultant 
in Belmont, Calif., who has a 
sophisticated link to the Internet 
through a powerful computer at 
home, is one of the few.... 'It's 
the ultimate vanity license plate 
in cyberspace,' Mr. Seiden said." 

And in February the Times 
detailed how Mark, whom it 
called "an expert in computer fire 
walls," aided the team of sleuths 
that caught Kevin Mitnick, one of 
the most brazen hackers in the 
world."

We were all saddened to hear of 
the death of Bill Irish. Bill was 
always friendly, even when he 
didn't have to be; for some of us, 
at least, his amazing one-handed 
catch to beat Yale is something 
we'll always remember. As Rick 
Assaf remembered him, "he 
could be equally intimidating or 
ingratiating depending on the sit¬ 
uation; he had heart." Bill left 
three teenage daughters, and a 
fund has been set up for them, 
called the William P. Irish Educa¬ 
tional Scholarship Fund. Anyone 
wishing to make a contribution 
should send it to: Jana D. Hand¬ 
work, MML Investors Services, 

100 Park Avenue, Suite 650, New 
York, N.Y. 10017; checks should 
be made payable to Oppenheimer 
Funds Mgmt. c/o W. P. Irish. 
Thanks to Steve Woods for get¬ 
ting all this info to me. 

Congratulations to former 
WKCR stalwart Fred Seibert, 
who got even closer to the music 
scene last November 22 when he 
married Robin Sloane, creative 
director for David Geffen's 
record company. Fred and Robin 
are expecting their first-born by 
the Fourth of July. It's a lucky kid 
to have as his dad the president 
of Hanna-Barbera—home of the 
Flintstones, the Jetsons, Huckle¬ 
berry Hound and other cartoon 
superstars. 

Sharif Abdus-Salaam is a

classmate Phil Schaap, he contin¬ 
ues to host jazz shows on WKCR. 
(You may have known Sharif 
during his College years as Ed 
Michael.) Also in Brooklyn is Fred 
Schneider, on Pierrepont St.; Fred 
lives there with his wife Harriet 
and two daughters Lauren, 11, 
and Stephanie, 7. He is a principal 
in the law firm of Gilman, Schnei¬ 
der & Komissarof on Wall St., and 
has been teaching at the Columbia 
School of Social Work for six years 
as an adjunct assistant professor. 
He also (along with many of us) 
calls Jim Minter "boss," doing 
interviews for the College in 
Brooklyn; James (Associate Direc¬

roommates once upon a time in 
Carman. He is still in touch with

Does it strike anyone else as 
strange that at the same time as 
we (the "Baby Boom") are said to 
have become a dominant force in 
American politics, the political 
agenda allegedly taking hold is 
the antithesis of what we were 
said to represent in the 60's and 
70's? Meanwhile, LBJ's Secretary 
of Defense Robert MacNamara is 
saying that our parents' genera¬ 
tion was wrong in supporting the 
war. Perhaps the world in A 
Clockwork Orange wasn't that odd 
after all. 

To me, it seems too early for 
our classmates to be assuming 
the positions of responsible 
adults. Yet George Van Amson 
(now in charge of Latin American 
equities at Morgan Stanley in 
New York) has become an 
Alumni Trustee of Columbia Uni¬ 
versity—perhaps the most presti¬ 
gious post an alumnus can 
assume. Warren Stern (a partner 
of the New York law firm of 
Wachtel Lipton Rosen & Katz) 
has been elected a member of the 
Board of Visitors of Columbia 
College (the influential group of 
loyal and significant alumni who 
help determine the destiny of the 
College). Congratulations to both 
for being recognized as leaders 
among the alumni and for devot¬ 
ing their limited time to a cause 
dear to us all. 

A while back I received a letter 
from Dr. Steve DeChemey, a 
classmate living down in Dela¬

of alumni work as chairman of the 
Middle Tennessee Columbia Uni¬

is director of the Medical Research 
Institute of Delaware, where he 
oversees human clinical trials of

of Delaware (the 11th largest hos¬ 
pital system in the U.S.). Steve's 
wife, Cleonice, runs a large private 
day-care center and was recently 
featured in a book on day care 
called Are Our Kids Alright? by 
Susan Bacon Dynerman B'74. 

Congratulations to Alan Good¬ 
man and his wife, Elena Seibert, 
on the birth of their son. Perry, 
last December 15. Alan recently 
wrote the pilot for a Nickelodeon 
mystery series featuring a young 
detective named Shelby Wink. 

The cable network has since 
given a green light for at least 
four episodes, Alan tells us. 

Looking deeper in my mailbag 
I find a letter from Dean Weber; 
"Following the demise of Lord, 
Day & Lord, I joined McDermott, 
Will & Emery where I became a 


partner on January 1. My wife, 
Lynne, was ordained to the 
priesthood in the Episcopal 
Church and she is the assistant at 
St. Elizabeth's Church in Ridge¬ 
wood, N.J. where we reside." 
John Egan tells me that he 
recently assumed the position of 
senior vice president in charge of 
the national accounts operation 
of Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., the 
New York-based multinational 
insurance brokerage that is sev¬ 
enth largest in the nation. And 
Victor Fortuno in Springfield, 

Va., writes, "My wonderful wife, 
Vicki, and I celebrated our first 
wedding anniversary recently, 
and I continue to serve as general 
counsel of the Legal Services 
Corporation, which is headquar¬ 
tered in Washington, D.C." 

While we have no judge of our 
own, some of you might have 
noticed that Ed Kornreich's wife, 
Shirley, was elected as a judge of 
the Civil Court in the last New 
York City election. Shirley is cur¬ 
rently sitting in the Bronx courts, 
while Ed is sitting in a big leather 
chair as a partner at the New 
York law firm of Proskauer, Rose, 
Goetz & Mendelsohn. 

Having missed a column, I 
have yet to report on the Sep¬ 
tember 1994 wedding of Isaac 
Palmer (to the lovely Patricia Bell). 
Isaac is currently the assistant gen¬ 
eral counsel of Ogden Services 
Corporation in New York, and 
Patty is studying at Teachers Col¬ 
lege. A big surprise at the wed¬ 
ding was the appearance of the 
dynamic duo of Jules Solobkow- 
icz and Louis Cortelezzi—two 
who were active in the campus 
music scene in our day and are 
still doing music. Jules is the man¬ 
ager of Willy DeVille (the Acad¬ 
emy Award nominee who is head 
of Mink DeVille), while Lou is still 
playing sax for Foreigner and 
Peter Allen. But before you get the 
idea that not everyone has sold 
out, Lou admitted that he has 
taken the LSAT's and is consider¬ 
ing going to law school. 

It seems more classmates are 
starting to write in and let us 
know what's happening in their 
lives after 20 years. If you have 
some news on yourself or class¬ 
mates, give me a call at work 
(212-236-5356) or fax it to me 
(212-236-5951). We haven't heard 
much from those living away 
from the East Coast lately, so I'll 
try to get on the phone and dig 
up some notes from classmates 
afar!

"Panther" on campus 

Popular actor and director Mario Van Peebles '78 (left) appeared at 
Altschul Auditorium on April 24 for a preview screening and discus¬ 
sion of his new movie, Panther, a docudrama about the turbulent 
history of the Black Panther movement. The evening's speakers 
included Manning Marable, director of the African-American Studies 
program (lohich co-sponsored the event with the Black Alumni Coun¬ 
cil) and one of Mr. Van Peebles' favorite College professors, former 
Associate Dean Michael Rosenthal. When the lights came up, Mr. 

Van Peebles engaged in Q&A and signed autographs, including one 
for Charty Thomas (right), a visitor from Howard University. 

Mr. Van Peebles, the star of the short-lived NBC detective series 
Sonny Spoon and co-star with Clint Eastwood in Heartbreak Ridge, 
made his directorial debut with New Jack City; he has since directed 
the multicultural western. Posse. His current venture was co-produced 
with his father, the noted writer and composer Melvin Van Peebles.

CCT and 1 conspire every couple 
of years to not run a column and 
see what happens. After 17 years, 
1 am proud to say that two of you 
noticed. I may be forced to resort 
to inventing classmates who do 
interesting things, or reviewing 
Jami Bernard's (B'78) latest book, 
which highlights famous movie 
actors who have ridden the #1 
train. Actually we have a good 
haul this time around. 

First, the two letters received 
within hours of your receiving 
the last issue. Joe Constant 
opens, "1 have become a media¬ 
tor with the State of Florida and 
am now affiliated with Florida 
Mediation Group. For the fifth 
year the Lions baseball team 
came to the Miami area to warm 
up. 1 went with Greg Ersek and 
we saw George Steinbrenner (the 
game was against Williams). 1 
told him it was probably a better 
game than the replacement Yan¬ 
kees. (Tom Mariam, do the statis¬ 
tics support that?) Please call if 
you're in Florida." 

Francis Collini wrote to say he 
was dismayed to find no notes. "1 
am a plastic and reconstructive 
surgeon in Shavertown, Pa. 
(Sounds like a follow-up to North¬ 
ern Exposure, no?) 1 am married to 
Susan and we have children Lau¬ 
ren, 8, and Joey, 5. Although there 
are not many Columbia gradu¬ 
ates in this area, we manage to 
survive and enjoy life." He notes 
that he was "tickled pink to see 
the Republicans take the House 
and Senate last year." 

1 will mention Tony Kushner 
and Mario Van Peebles just for 
the star quality it brings to the 
column. Neither has written in, 
but both are doing quite well. 

Here's a contact to mark down 
for about 15 years from now: 
Kevin Slawin, M.D. notes that he 
was "recently appointed director 
of the Baylor Prostate Center" 
which is doing state-of-the-art 
research and treatment for you- 
know-whaf. Kevin lives in Hous¬ 
ton with wife Jordana and chil¬ 
dren Jeremy, 5, and Eden, 2. 

Laurence Quinn of Valley 
Stream, N.Y. is married to Mari¬ 
anne. They are the parents of 
Thomas, 3, and a new one on the 
way. Larry teaches biology and 
chemistry at Elmont Memorial 
High School. 

Busy in his fifth year as direc¬ 
tor of orchestra and chamber 
music at Brown, Paul Phillips 
had a small role in the movie 
True Lies. 

William Hartung made a name 
for himself last year with the pub¬ 


lication of a book on how to con¬ 
trol military arms exports that 
received tremendous reviews. 

And Weapons for All. After serving 
as a senior staff member to Bob 
Abrams '60, Bill has been at the 
World Policy Institute. Married to 
Audrey Waysse in 1990, he has a 
one-year-old girl, Emma. 

Merrill Weber has moved 
over time from journalism to law 
and now on to securities in 
Chicago, where he has created 
the Israel Growth Eund. Invest¬ 
ing in their own future, he and 
wife Mindy have two children, 
Stephanie, 5, and Sarah, 2. 

I saw Tim Weiner, ex-WKCR 
and now New York Times reporter, 
and his wife Katherine Doyle, at 
a mutual friend's wedding last 
year. They are doing great. Tim is 
on the CIA beat, and can be seen 
regularly on page 1. 

Warren Chin takes the prize 
this issue with his letter: "Love 
being married to Julie, was 
recently re-elected as president of 
the local Elorida Osteopathic 
Medical Society. No kids yet, but 
we want five, and I've been 
doing stand-up comedy at local 
clubs. I'm also writing an epic 
novel about fish communications 
that I hope will be up there with 
Jurassic Park." 

We're fine in New Haven. 
Daughters Elana, 5, and Joy, 1, 
are wonderful and wife Marian 
Chertow B'77 recently passed her 
orals at Yale in environmental 
policy. Call if you're passing 
through.

I've waited five years to give the 
following news to you: my book 
is finally being published this 
spring. Entitled Wannabe: A 
Would-Be Player's Misadventures in 


Hollywood, it is the chronicle of 
my experiences in the movie 
industry. Check it out and let me 
know what you think of it (com¬ 
pliments only, please). 

George Warren wrote in for the 
first time. He works as marketing 
manager for the K-12 market at 
Dell Computer in Round Rock, 
Texas. In this column's first entry 
into cyberspace, George would 
like to discuss ideas with class¬ 
mates on the use of computers in 
the classroom. Please e-mail him 
your thoughts at: george_war- 
ren@dell.com. George is married 
to Sarah Thomas E'87 and they 
have two boys, Andrew, 1, and 
Geordie, 3. Sergio Akselrad also 
took note of my plea for class 
news and let us know that he's 
down in Miami, where he's a v.p. 
with Goldman Sachs. He is 
engaged to Catherine Wallace and 
will be married later this year. 

My apologies to Les Holo for 
not including his update sooner. 
Les lives in Connecticut with his 
wife, Alison, and their two-year- 
old daughter, Barrett. A graduate 
of Columbia Law, Les is a litiga¬ 
tor at Wiggin & Dana in New 
Haven. Charles Fomara writes 
that in the fall he will give up 
teaching to pursue singing. 

"Have any '86 graduates become 
opera impresarios who are look¬ 
ing for a lyric baritone?" he asks. 
Daniel Chenok is living in D.C. 
and enjoying life with his wife Jill 
Levison '87. He helps formulate 
education and workforce policy 
at the Office of Management & 
Budget. Rick Blumenthal, the 
only Columbia grad to have 
posed for the yearbook with a 
mouse on his shoulder, is living 
in Orange, Calif, where he is a 
practicing pediatrician with his 
wife Melanie. They have a one- 
year-old son, Aaron. 

Next time you complain about 
the tough day you're having at 
the office, think of Lt. Thomas 
Mezzetti, who has been serving 
off the coast of Bosnia-Herze- 
govina with the 22nd Marine 
Expeditionary Unit as part of the 
USS Nassau Amphibious Ready 
Group. Tom, who joined the 
Navy seven years ago, set sail 
aboard the Nassau for the 
Mediterranean Sea last October 
for a six-month overseas deploy¬ 
ment. His unit is equipped with 
helicopters, conventional landing 
gear, and high-speed-air-cush- 
ioned assault craft, and is capable 
of conducting a variety of mis¬ 
sions, from reconnaissance and 
amphibious assaults to evacuat¬ 
ing civilians and providing 
humanitarian aid. We wish Tom 
godspeed during his stint there.

I received from Thomas King a 
long letter all about bugs. Ento¬ 
mology has been Thomas's hobby 
since childhood, and he now sells 
pesticides for a small distributor 
in Philadelphia. He has published 
several scientific articles on pesti¬ 
cides, writes a monthly column 
on the subject for a local newspa¬ 
per, and has done segments for 
Philly TV stations. He's also writ¬ 
ten, and is now marketing, a soft¬ 
ware package on bug killing. In 
his spare time, Thomas is getting 
his master's degree in the com¬ 
puter department at Temple Uni¬ 
versity. He is married to Arlene 
Gormley, and they have a son, 
Jacob, who was born in 1990. 

Patricia Schnaidt isn't into 
bugs (that I know of) but she is 
into computers. She is the editor- 
in-chief of Network Computing, a 
magazine for people who man¬ 
age enterprise-wide computer 
networks. Previously, Patricia 
was editor-in-chief of LAN Maga¬ 
zine, also in San Francisco, and 
the founding owner of another 
magazine, Telecom Library. She 
has also written several books, 
including Enterprise-wide Net¬ 
working, which was published by 
Prentice-Hall in 1992. Patricia 
says writing a book is a lot of 
work—but it's all worth it when 
she walks into Barnes & Noble 
and sees it on the shelf! 

After receiving a master's in 
architecture at Yale in 1990, Lance 
Hosey returned to New York. He's 
worked in several architecture 
firms, most recently Gwathmey 
Siegel, the firm that designed the 
addition to the Guggenheim 
Museum. When he is not working, 
Lance and Dave Sobel '89 play in 
a blues band that haunts "lots of 
beer-swilling dives in questionable 
neighborhoods." Lance and Heidi 
Hackford have wedding plans for 
August at the Buffalo Historic 
Society. Honeymoon plans are to 
yodel and impersonate the Von 
Trapps in the Austrian Alps, After 
which Lance will move to Wash¬ 
ington, D.C., where Heidi is get¬ 
ting her Ph.D. in American social 
history at American University. 

And in other news... Mitch 
Swergold is an associate at the 
law firm of Ericksen, Arbuthnot, 
Kilduff, Day and Lindstrom in 
San Francisco. He is also a mem¬ 
ber of the board of directors of 
the Columbia Alumni Club for 
Northern California. Herbert 
Block has moved to Washington, 
D.C., and is working for the Clin¬ 
ton administration as deputy 
director for intergovernmental 
relations at the Corporation for 
National Service.

What makes Wanda teach? 


Wanda Holland '89 (right), the director of student life at New York's 
Chapin School, was the 1995 recipient of the Alumna Achievement 
Award given by Columbia College Women, the alumnae organization. 
She is pictured at the award reception held at Maison Franqaise on 
March 30 sharing a light moment with Cathy Webster '87, dean of 
first-year students at Barnard. The evening's keynote speaker was for¬ 
mer Columbia assistant professor of history and current New York 
State lieutenant governor Elizabeth McCaughey. 

Ms. Holland, who was named Chapin's student life director last 
August after teaching at the school for four years, holds a master's 
degree from Teachers College, where she is pursuing a doctorate in 
educational administration. When she received her award, she 
quipped that if she had a dollar for every time someone asked her 
"Why is a smart girl like you going into education?" she would be 
wealthy enough to retire. She also shared her philosophy of work and 
life: "The reason I teach is because I want to be immortal."

with little time for fun, I am most 


appreciative of letters from class¬ 
mates, especially art note cards. 
Jared Goldstein, writing in on a 
beautiful watercolor by Winslow 
Homer, is the director of devel¬ 
opment for Asian-Americans for 
Equality, a Chinatown commu¬ 
nity development organization. 
He was profiled in New York 
Newsday in March; David Sobel 
and Frank Lang '89 work with 
him. 

Jared is also co-founding a 
grassroots community organiza¬ 
tion on the Lower East Side and 
a city-wide affordable-housing 
advocacy group. 

On a conte crayon piece by 
Georges Seurat, Michelle Gra¬ 
ham writes that she is switching 
gears, having spent the last six 
years in marketing, and is now 
enrolled at the Cardozo School of 
Law on a three-year scholarship. 
John Sherwood sends e-mail 
from George Washington Univer¬ 
sity. He successfully defended his 
dissertation on Air Force fighter 
pilots in Korea, and is working as 
a military historian at the U.S. 
Army Center of Military History. 
Wendy Brandeis, writing in on a 
seasonal New Yorker notecard, is 
an assistant news editor for the 
Wall Street Journal, where she 
works on the national desk and 
"once in a blue moon writes a 
short and hopefully amusing 
story." She is also a contributing 
music writer for City Magazine. 
Chris Lorentz (university letter¬ 
head) is doing very well in 
Northern Kentucky, where he is a 
professor at Thomas More Col¬ 
lege, teaching primarily genetics 
and physiology. Chris received 
his Ph.D. in ecology from Kent 
State. This summer, he hopes to 
initiate a research program at the 
school's field station on the Ohio 
River. Chris writes that Rodney 
Paul and his wife Tammy had 
their second son in November. 

On a simple yet respectable note- 
card with aqua trim, Melissa 
Raphaely reports that she has 
received her MBA/Master's in 
city planning from Cal-Berkeley. 
Melissa has been doing much 
traveling, having recently 
returned from a stint in South 
Africa and having bypassed our 
reunion for the enchantment of 
Italy. Melissa reports that Amy 
Saffer Ariel works for a software 
company in Israel and that 
Moj deli Khagan Danial has a 
new son. Kaivan Shakib (corpo¬ 
rate letterhead), a wellspring of 
Columbia news, writes: Ed Ruffo 
has joined the law firm of 
Dankner & Milstein in N.Y.C. 
Stacy Osborne, having graduated 
from St. John's, is an attorney 
with the S.E.C. in Washington, 
D.C. Niloo Razi graduated from 
Harvard Law, traveled exten¬ 


sively through southeast Asia, 
and has now settled in L.A., 
working for O'Melveny & Myers. 
Sam Marchiano works for the 
Sci-Fi Channel and lives in Brook¬ 
lyn Heights, and Marisa Pappa- 
dio has left Andersen Consulting 
and has joined up with J. P. Mor¬ 
gan. Finally, Joanna Lapkin 
responds to CCT's news retrieval 
system, informing us of her May 
marriage to Bernard Ravina. This 
summer, Joanna will begin her 
psychology internship in comple¬ 
tion of her Ph.D. in clinical psy¬ 
chology. Bernard will have 
earned his M.D. from Johns Hop¬ 
kins Medical School, too. 

Congratulations! Keep the 
news coming, friends. Best 
Regards. Amy Hope.

Apparently, because of overruns 
in our power issue, our submis¬

about three typed lines. I typed 
small. 

Kirsten Mellor, Lisa Dabney 
and Margaret Flynn are planning 
a three-week trip to Southeast 
Asia. Kirsten reports that she 
graduates from Villanova Law 
School in May. She will be mov¬ 
ing to Boston and become associ¬ 
ated with the firm Bingham, 

Dana & Gould. 

Joel Tranter and Erika Henik 
were married last year in Wood- 
cliff Lake, N.J. Adam Lindgren 
was the best man, and about a 
million of our former classmates 
were there, including Colin 
Campbell, Peter Neisuler, Dan 
Sackrowitz and Lisa Cohen as 
witnesses, and Steve Winnick, 
Eric Yu, Dan Binderman, Rachel 
Cowan, Jen Leiber, Jeff Rake, 
Paulette Light, Liz Lubow and 
Chris Young. Joel is an associate 
city planner in the beautiful wine 
country of Sonoma, Calif., and 
Erika is the senior research editor 
at Montgomery Securities in San 
Francisco. 

Naomi Gendler is in her sec¬ 
ond year of a four-year joint 
degree program at Harvard Law 
School and the Kennedy School 
of Government. She spent last 
summer in Kiev assisting in Har¬ 
vard's Project on Economic 
Reform in the Ukraine. 

Catherine Censor is the fea¬ 
tures editor of Weight Watchers 
magazine. She recently married 
Thomas Shemo at the St. Regis. 

Durahn Taylor recently passed 
his oral exams for Columbia's 
doctoral program in history. 
Beginning in the fall, he will be 
teaching C.C. as a preceptor while

researching his dissertation. 

Mark Seidenberg tells me that 
all is well at Milbank, Tweed, 
where he works in the bankruptcy 
department. He says that Patricia 
Sullivan is on board there, too. 

Chris Roth, Paul Greenberg, 
John Vincenti, Julie Schwartz 
and I attended the wedding of 
Michael Better E'90 and Ellen 
Legato. Chris is currently a sec¬ 
ond-year medical student at the 
Medical College of Richmond in 
Virginia where, he says, he is 
experiencing "a high index of suf¬ 
fering." John is deeply involved in 
lawyering, guitar lessons, and Ital¬ 
ian classes, and now, having been 
accepted to NYU Business School, 
will be taking more classes at 
night. Evidently, John is not inter¬ 
ested in sleeping much for the 
next few years. Julie is likewise 
wildly busy, finishing her last 
year of classes at Northeastern 
Law School, and being actively 
involved on campus as president 
of the Law Students Association 
and an assistant in a children's 
rights project. Paul is... well, we 
all know what Paul has been up 
to, but in addition to being "the 
voice" for New York sports news 
on radio, Paul has done, and con¬ 
tinues to pursue, voice-overs for 
various commercials. The latest 
from Paul is that he is leaving 
1010 WINS to attend Columbia 
Business School in September. He 
plans on continuing his voice-over 
work at the same time. 

For myself, the big news is that 
I recently got engaged to my girl¬ 
friend, Sandra, the most beautiful 
person I wiU ever meet. And my 
parents are flipping—my older 
sister and younger brother are 
also getting married this year. 

One note for those of you who 
pretend to abhor even the thought 
of marriage: you are missing the 
best of life. 

If you haven't called in or 
mailed any info, now's the time. 
Trust me. Your friends want to 
hear from you.

Well, here it is. The final column 
that I get to write while I am a 
Columbia student. Now more 
than ever I am going to be rely¬ 
ing on all of you to get me the 
information I need to keep this 
going. Please help support the 
process and drop me a line when 
you can. 

Before I do any more shame¬ 


less plugging, an apology is in 
order. One of the things about 
doing a job like this is that you 
are only as good as your informa¬ 
tion. When you are given bad 
information, and no one corrects 
you on it, you might even make 
the same dumb mistake twice. So 
it is with Dara-Lynn Weiss, who I 
have now twice referred to as 
being CC'91. She is, in fact CC'92. 
I will protect the (not-so) innocent 
and not tell you who told me she 
was '91, and shoulder the blame 
myself. I'm truly sorry, Dara; it 
won't happen again. 

On to the class news. Can you 
believe our first big reunion is 
right around the corner? In a 
scant two years, we'll have been 
out of Columbia and Morning- 
side Heights for five years. I got 
a call from our old class presi¬ 
dent Wah Chen, who assures me 
that the ball is already rolling 
and that we can certainly count 
on a gala bash. She is certainly 
looking for any and all help from 
us in planning the event. If 
you're interested, and have the 
time, contact her through the 
alumni office. 

I ran into Evan Ambinder in an 
Upper West Side store, Candle- 
Schtick. He has teamed up with 
Gabe Wiener to form a recording 
business. Quintessential Sound, 
Inc. The two seem to be doing 
good business with each other 
and for the New York area. 

It would appear that Justin 
Heilman and I will be spending 
some time together this summer 
studying for the New York Bar 
Exam. Justin tells me that Stew¬ 
art Rosman is currently attend¬ 
ing Michigan Business School. 

Sarah Wolman writes that she 
has completed the first year of a 
dual degree program in law and 
sociology here at Columbia. She's 
off for a summer at the Anti-Dis¬ 
crimination Board of New South 
Wales, Australia, in Sydney. She's 
hoping to focus on legislative 
responses to gender-based dis¬ 
crimination. 

Rob Goldman is studjdng law 
out on the West Coast (at UCLA), 
where he reports that all is well. He 
did move, however, and wanted 
his classmates to know he can now 
be reached at 1235 North Harper 
Avenue, #29, Los Angeles, Calif. 
90048. You can also reach him at 
goldman@law3.law.ucla.edu. 
Sheesh, my column has hit the 
information superhighway. 

On August 6,1994, Abby 
Black married Rick Elbaum '93L. 
Jill Tobia, Jen Alessi, and Robin 
Bass B'92 were all there to share 
in the festivities. Abby now 
works at Chemical Bank in the 
private banking group. 

The long-distance award for 
this column goes to Rachel 


Wasserman, who writes from 
Israel, where she has been for the 
past two years. She is currently 
working as a desktop publisher 
doing layout work and continu¬ 
ing to study. She asked me to 
pass along her address, as she 
misses her CC'92 buddies. It is 
11/11 Rehov Mishkelov, Har Not, 
Jersusalem, Israel. 

Lawrence Ma'ayan writes that 
he is currently a first-year at the 
University of Pittsburgh School of 
Medicine. Prior to that he served 
as a family worker for the NYC 
public schools and as a researcher 
in an oncology lab at the Brook¬ 
lyn Veteran's Administration 
Medical Center. 

That's all for now. Stay in 
touch.

A faint, expectant ticking sound 
seems to have strangely recom¬ 
menced o'er these last many 
months as we move further and 
further away from our gradua¬ 
tion date. One of the rare perks 
of this awkward alumni adoles¬ 
cence is the increasingly steady 
stream of news from our friends 
around the country. 

A pair of soccer shoes and a 
perpetual smile is what 1 think of 
when I remember Molly Sellner, 
a friendly face from the eighth 
floor of Schapiro Hall freshman 
year. Molly writes that she has 
been working as a legislative aid 
for NYC Council Member Stan¬ 
ley Michels. After volunteering 
on several local and state cam¬ 
paigns last fall she reports that 
she has finally recovered from 
the losses. Molly has kept in 
touch with Lucy Ruwitch, who 
will be heading to medical school 
next year. Lucy is working in a 
genetics lab at P&S. I was happy 
to read that Molly is still playing 
soccer in an amateur women's 
league in NYC. 

I was forwarded a letter from 
the Mississippi Teachers Corps 
informing me that Rodney 
Crump is currently instructing 
high school students in the rural 
school districts of Canton, Miss. 
The letter came with an interest¬ 
ing brochure describing the two- 
year professional program, which 
I would be happy to share with 
anyone who might be thinking of 
using their Columbia degree to 
help foster young minds. 

While unsuspectingly flipping 
through the Arts and Leisure sec¬ 
tion of The New York Times in 
search of half-price theater tick¬ 
ets, I was thrilled to find that 
actress Cara Buono continues her 
ascent to super-stardom. Make 
way, Uma Thurman. 


After working and studying in 
Jerusalem for a year on a Dorot 
Fellowship, David Lerner says 
he is back in the old neighbor¬ 
hood. He is studying for the rab¬ 
binate at the Jewish Theological 
Seminary, where he won a 
Wexner Graduate Fellowship. An 
article he wrote on early Jewish 
mysticism was recently pub¬ 
lished in Conservative Judaism 
magazine. 

Angela Okajima remembered 
me from the course we took 
together on Japanese culture and 
sent a whole bunch of news from 
pal Romsai Boonyasai. I regret 
that I must wait until the next col¬ 
umn to fit all the names, but I 
should mention in the meantime 
that Angela, who was at the Insti¬ 
tute for Medieval Japanese Studies 
at Columbia, is now at Alfred Uni¬ 
versity's New York State College 
of Ceramics. Alfred is about an 
hour and a half west of Ithaca, she 
writes, and the town's population 
is about the size of the College. 
Nevertheless, Angela reports that 
she is thrilled to be there as she 
works towards her second bache¬ 
lor's degree in art. 

Although I never thought 1 
was one to jump on the informa¬ 
tion superhighway bandwagon, I 
now invite you to send your 
news via e-mail to e.cabral@ford- 
found.org. It would be a pleasure 
to hear what is going on in the 
world through the wonders of 
cyberspace, mainly because I just 
love that reaffirming little jingle 
my computer plays when it 
receives incoming mail: Ta-da!

I fear this column has become a 
casualty of the super information 
autobahn. To any of you who 
may have written me via e-mail, 

I must apologize. I have, unfortu¬ 
nately, fallen off-line and have 
not been able to reach my e-mail 
files for months. Do, if you don't 
appear this time around, blame it 
on technology. I'm still trying to 
get my modem to speak to these 
wacky German ones, so with 
luck I'll get your notes in time for 
the next issue. Please feel free to 
send any information to CCT, 
since they'll pass it on to me. 

On to the people who chose a 
more old-fashioned mode of

Buono lights up Broadway 

Cara Buono '93 returned to Broadway on April 30 for a nine-week 
revival of Tennessee Williams' The Rose Tattoo at the Circle in the 
Square Theatre; her performance as Rosa, the teen-age daughter of 
Mercedes Ruehl, has prompted praise from Ben Brantley of The New 
York Times ("charmingly played") and Howard Kissel '64 of the 
New York Daily News ("beautiful work"). A Bronx native, Ms. 
Buono has been acting since she was 12, when she was cast as a 
"fourteen-year-old pregnant street punk" in Harvey Fierstein's 
Spookhouse. Her first movie appearance was with Brian Dennehy 
'60 in Gladiator; she has since been in Waterland with Jeremy Irons 
and Ethan Hawke and The Cowboy Way with Woody Harrelson and 
Kiefer Sutherland. Other work has included a recurring role on the 
series I'll Fly Away and the upcoming films Kicking & Screaming 
with Eric Stoltz and Killer, starring James Woods. 

"If adrenaline were a beauty aid," commented Us magazine, "Cara 
Buono could run the East Coast distributorship." Indeed, Ms. Buono 
completed a double major of English and political science in three years 
at the College while supporting herself with her acting. Her social life 
admittedly suffered. "I came out of my dorm room one day, and the 
people in the hallway told me they thought that room was empty."

Games in Argentina, and the 1996 
Olympics in Atlanta. She 
appeared in the November 1994 
issue of Sports Illustrated for Kids 
and even has her own sports card 
from that issue. She has also been 
working as a research assistant at 
the University of Rochester's 
business school and plans to 
apply to medical school for the 
fall of 1996. 

Elliot Regenstein writes me 
some details about his job at 
the commissioner's office of 
the City of New York/Parks & 
Recreation. He says it's great 
and he's learning a lot about 
government. He says Nina 
Habib is also on the commis¬ 
sioner's staff and Steve Kovacs 
works in the revenue division. 
Elliot also reports that 
Stephanie Geosits is working in 
the C.U. Sports Information 
Office, and Brian Orefice and 
Rocky Gocella continue to work 
at Columbia sporting events. 

David Ho writes that he's been 
doing oceanographic research in 
Miami. He's currently working 
on a project in the Indian Ocean. 
He has already traveled to Puerto 
Rico for research and plans to go 


to South Africa, Sri Lanka, Oman, 
Thailand, Hong Kong, San Fran¬ 
cisco and Seattle before returning 
to Miami. 

Shawn Landres reports that he 
is "happily ensconced" in the 
religious studies department at 
U.C.-Santa Barbara. He's plan¬ 
ning to return to Slovakia this 
summer to teach English and do 
some research. He also won the 
first annual Bess Meyerson 
Award for editorial/opinion 
writing. The award was given by 
the New York Anti-Defamation 
League for writing about inter¬ 
group relations and multicultur- 
alism in New York, Connecticut 
and New Jersey college newspa¬ 
pers. Shawn received it for his 
Spectator column, "If Not Now, 
When?" 

Mary Killackey, still working 
hard at P&S, writes that she 
recently saw Josh Levy, who is a 
Columbia Admissions Officer 
and a SIPA student. She also tells 
me that John Katz has left New 
York for the more pleasant slopes 
of Colorado. 

Saskia Traill is working in not- 
for-profit education in New York 
until this summer, and then plans 


to go to London until January 
1996. Robert McLaughlin wiU be 
in Washington, D.C. this summer 
doing research on archaeology law 
for the National Trust for Historic 
Preservation. Philip Greenspan is 
a first-year medical student at 
Ohio State University in Colum¬ 
bus. Richard T. Spencer is attend¬ 
ing law school at the University of 
Florida, Gainesville, and plans to 
spend a semester studying interna¬ 
tional law in Frankfurt, Germany. 

And finally, on a personal note, 
Jamal Davis is engaged to Kory 
Hasandras. The two were intro¬ 
duced by Isaiah Delemar '93, who 
himself is engaged to Natalie 
Aristide. 

And that's the way the world 
looks for CC '94. Keep the news 
flowing.

While we were the last class to 
register in the old gym and the 
first in a while not to receive 
beanies, the Class of '95 is finally 
ready to leave the comfort of 
Columbia and the security of 
Morningside Heights. 

Since this is our first class notes 
column, I strongly encourage you 
to write and keep us all informed 
about your new lives away from 
Butler Library and the Steps. 

Not everyone will be leaving 
Columbia that quickly. Ami 
Vaidya, Anna Hemnes, Bobby 
Jawetz and David Bomback will 
head up to P&S as first-year med¬ 
ical students; Sharon Brouse, 
Dave Light (eventually) and 
Jonathan Berkun will matriculate 
at the Jewish Theological Semi¬ 
nary as rabbinical students; 

James Stoterau will attend the 
graduate division in film (and tell 
your younger siblings coming 
here next year to beware, because 
James will also become the RD of 
Carman); Adreme Shubrick will 
study at the Law School. 

Many of us will remain in 
New York in other incarnations, 
and a multitude will embark on 
the Wall Street scene: Hilton 
Romanski and Jillian Moo- 
Young will head down to J. P. 
Morgan, Gargi Banerjee to Gold¬ 
man Sachs and Craig Bernstein 
to Salomon Brothers; Jason Seda 
will study New York government 
as an Urban Fellow; Class Presi¬ 
dent Bryonn Bain, who is only 
20 years old, will be working 
either for the AFL-CIO as a labor 
organizer or "working on my 
music" in New York. 

Others will leave the city: 

Mark Kravitz will become an 
eyeglasses expert as a junior 



executive at For Eyes back home 
in Miami; heading back to Hous¬ 
ton, Ryan Mossman will work 
for Andersen Consulting; Jimmy 
Hung will defer med school for 
one year to work in health care 
consulting at Coopers & Lybrand 
in Chicago; Owen Grover will be 
managing the Portland branch of 
a not-for-profit fundraising 
group; Emily Straus will move to 
L.A., where she has never even 
visited before, and will teach ele¬ 
mentary school through the 
Teach for America program; and 
Allyson Baker will be working 
in some city for some Democrat 
on some campaign. 

And a bunch will even leave 
the country. David Landreth will 
move to Rome to teach English; 
Emily Hu will also teach English 
in Beijing; as a Fulbright scholar 
in Argentina, Katie Fleet will 
study immigration; Jessica Zim¬ 
merman will research the stars 
for the Astronomy department in 
Chile; Michael Tsang will teach 
English in Japan through the JET 
program; Jee Kim (I ran into him 
in the Sistine Chapel over Winter 
break) will be a Kellett Fellow at 
Oxford; Jed Weiner will study 
the Middle East at St. Anthony's 
College, Oxford; Townsend 
Lansing will study in Germany 
on a fellowship. 

This is a sample of what is to 
come. At press time, I do not 
have a permanent address, but 
please send me what you are 
doing in care of CCT. Congratu¬ 
lations to the Class of '95! I hope 
to hear from all of you soon....

The President's Box 

Our goals are in sight 

BY Martin S. Kaplan '61 

President, Columbia College Alumni Association 


W e continue to make tremen¬ 
dous progress toward the 
goals set forth in the Report 
on the Future of Columbia 
College. In addition to continuing the core 
curriculum's 75th anniversary with the most 
successful Dean's Day ever, there is other 
great news to report: 

1) Furnald Hall will be completely 
refurbished by September 1996. When it 
reopens, it will become the sixth dormitory 
to join our formal house system, which 
will then include 85 percent of the student 
body. Each house has offices for deans and advisors to 
serve student needs, and three houses have faculty-in- 
residence. 

2) The Career Services Office has been transferred from 
the University to the College, reporting to the Dean of 
Students, with the goal of providing better service. The 
house deans will be directly involved with Career Services 
in order to improve that function. 

3) The Dean of Students' Office is also working with 
the Alumni Association to assist students in finding 
summer jobs, and in providing career advice and guid¬ 
ance. You will hear more about this program as we 


develop it, first in the New York area, and 
then in other locations with significant 
groups of alumni. 

4) We now have over 3,000 alumni work¬ 
ing with the Alumni Representative Com¬ 
mittee, which helps recruit and interview 
prospective students. Our applications are 
now at an all-time high, with 8,712 appli¬ 
cants for the Class of '99. As the reputation 
of the College continues to rise (as it did this 
year in the U.S. News & World Report survey), 
we will need to involve more alumni in this 
important process. 

5) Final plans for the new student center and the new 
College Library have been presented to the Alumni 
Association board and the Board of Visitors. Meanwhile, 
the University and College are busily engaged in planning 
for two new dormitories and improved athletic facilities. 

6) Finally, our celebration of the 75th anniversary of the 
Core was highlighted at Dean's Day by a powerful, elo¬ 
quent and important address by Judge Jose Cabranes '61 
which emphasized the value of a core curriculum for all 
students, regardless of gender, race or ethnicity. The speech 
is reprinted in the forthcoming issue of Columbia Magazine. 

I urge all of you to read it. 



The Manhattan Project 

(continued from page 21) 


By that time, the mind-boggling engi¬ 
neering required to make all those 
materials, tubes, pumps, seals and bar¬ 
riers work efficiently on a mass scale 
had caused Columbia's atomic 
research to expand exponentially. 
Because of space limitations on 
Morningside Heights, as well as for 
political and security reasons (some 
officials feared German U-boats com¬ 
ing up the Hudson River), every piece 
of portable atomic research equipment 
used in Fermi's atomic pile research, 
from a can opener to 18 tons of 
graphite, had been moved in the sum¬ 
mer of 1942 from Columbia to the 
University of Chicago, where the first 
self-sustaining chain reaction was per¬ 
formed in a squash court under Stagg 
Field on December 2,1942. 

Most wartime Columbia students 
graduated without knowing what had 


been going on just outside their dorm 
rooms. Fermi's and Urey's research 
programs were governed by a newly 
formed district of the U.S. Army Corps 
of Engineers, with no territorial limits, 
which was created to oversee atomic 
energy research. Headquartered in 
Manhattan, it became known as the 
Manhattan District, and the research 
program became known as the 
Manhattan District Project. The mili¬ 
tary purposely used a nondescript 
bureaucratic name to arouse less atten¬ 
tion and curiosity. 

"We asked the government whether 
[the atomic pile] should be guarded," 
Pegram later wrote, "and we were told 
that less attention would be attracted 
to it if no special precautions appeared 
to be taken. As it happened no one 
showed any interest in what a few sci¬ 
entists were doing in the basement of 
Schermerhorn. In fact, no one seemed 
particularly curious at any time, not 
even when the lack of space for the 


gaseous diffusion work of Dr. 

Dunning forced us to take over 
garages and finally apartment houses 
on Morningside Heights." 

On August 6,1945, the world sud¬ 
denly took notice. That morning. 
Havens was in the basement of Pupin 
when the telephone rang. 

"It was someone from an interna¬ 
tional news service," he recalled. "He 
said, "President Truman has just 
announced the dropping of a bomb 
equivalent to 12,500 tons of TNT. We 
don't understand how it works. Can 
you explain it to us?' 

"I said, T never heard of it' and 
hung up," Havens said. He was slight¬ 
ly more forthcoming when his wife 
asked him what he had been working

his falsies, and as we came around I 
kicked them out to about the tenth row 
of the Astor—to the delight of the 
audience. We did take our dancing 
seriously, and we got pretty good (my 
girlfriend of the time complimented us 
on our realism). Frank Gagen, a Broad¬ 
way choreographer who directed the 
Roxy chorus, was our instructor. At 
every rehearsal he showed up with a 
different chorus girl, always introduc¬ 
ing her as his "sister." 

l.A.L. Diamond '41 was the man 
who put the entire show together. I 
still recall some of his great songs, like 
"Pitching Woo in An Igloo."

Schindler's worth 

In "The Schindler Complacency" [Fall 
1994], Jason Epstein '49 makes two 
good points: namely, that Steven Spiel¬ 
berg's film Schindler's List does not 
question why or how our species 
became capable of such horrendous evil 
as the Holocaust, and that Oskar 
Schindler did not make a statistically 
significant difference in the outcome of 
that genocide. But this does not mean 
the film takes the Holocaust for granted 
and is thus a "moral failure," or that 
Schindler's deeds were insignificant. 

Although the questions raised by the 
Holocaust and similar atrocities about 
our potential for evil are of the utmost 
importance, they are not the theme of 
Spielberg's film. What Schindler's List 
aims to do, and does so dramatically, is 
to portray one man, in the midst of 
unspeakable evil, standing up and mak¬ 
ing a difference. And the hundreds of 
lives that Schindler saved made a dif¬ 
ference—as would have any number. 

Schindler's example is not only 
worth recognizing and admiring, it is 
worth examining. Great heroes and 
their allies provide models from which 
we can learn and be inspired. How can 
we dismiss a portrayal of Schindler's 
acts because he had wild character 
inconsistencies, was like someone 
"from a different planet," was irreplica- 
ble and did not reverse the Holocaust? 
That would be like saying that no

painter should study Van Gogh because 
he went crazy and no one could paint 
like him; no writer can learn from 
James Joyce because he was an alco¬ 
holic and a genius; no composer should 
dare study the likes of Beethoven, and 
so on. As for the rest of us, why even 
acquaint ourselves with these artists 
and their creations? They led personal 
lives we should not emulate, made 
great art we could not imitate, and did 
not turn the course of history. 

We cannot have it both ways, saying 
that the tyranny man inflicts on his 
own species must be questioned and 
examined, while at the same time not 
studying how heroes rise up against 
such tyranny. In so movingly illustrat¬ 
ing one example, Steven Spielberg has 
performed a great service.

Insufficient illumination 

Re Marshall D. Mascott '48's letter, 
"William Casey: Another view" [Win¬ 
ter 1995]: Mr. Mascott fails to under¬ 
stand the extent of the professor's con¬ 
tributions. What he writes testifies to 
his own crankiness. His comments fail 
to provide critical insight into Profes¬ 
sor Casey's teachings, and they shed 
no light on his life, his personality or 
his ideals. They do, however, suggest 
that while Mr. Mascott attended 
Casey's lectures, his "reverie" was 
focused elsewhere. 

fohn H. Seaman '50, M.D. 

FOREST HILLS, N.Y. 

Lost innocence 

You have received, I am sure, a pile of 
letters defending William Casey from 
Marshall Mascott's blistering attack in 
your last issue. Professor Casey needs 
no defense beyond that pile, but I 
should like to offer two observations: 

First, what a shame that Mr. Mas¬ 
cott has so completely lost touch with 
his "immature" 19-year-old self. 

Things were apparently not always 
hopeless if as a young student he was 
willing to sit through a course in 
Caseyology. The frustrated and bitter 
ideologue of today shows how drasti¬ 
cally things can change (I trust there 
were good reasons, did I but know 
them). For my own part I count as 
perhaps the greatest blessing Colum¬ 
bia bestowed on me a social con¬ 
science strong enough to withstand 
later temptations to grab at all the 
chips on the table. 


Second, I would ask Mr. Mascott to 
re-read the quotation from Casey's 1944 
letter that Mr. Mascott himself chooses 
to epitomize the scorn he feels for his 
old teacher (you might try substituting 
"FDR" for "this war"): "The same old 
generation of wreckers... untouched by 
this war, except that it has made them 
unprecedentedly rich and arrogant... 
look forward to a return to the good 
old days when, with abounding unem¬ 
ployment, they imagine that they can 
break trade unions, reduce wages, 
lengthen working hours and put what 
they regard as the 'lower classes' in 
their proper place again." 

Would William Casey have written 
any differently after reading the Con¬ 
tract with America?

Intimate acquaintances 

Your Winter 1995 issue struck a chord in 
the aging breast of this alumnus. Four 
fairly intimate acquaintances and one 
childhood friend appeared in your pages. 
One was my classmate John Crymble, 
who attended kindergarten with me in 
Leonia, N.J. around 73 years ago. 

I played tennis frequently with the 
father of Ted de Bary '41 a few years 
later and well remember Ted and his 
brother, Marquette. I graduated from 
Columbia Law School the same year 
Ted finished college. 

Oliver Lissitzyn '33 and I served 
together on the Aviation Committee of 
the Bar Association of the City of New 
York for a number of years. His picture 
on page 30 brings back my memory of 
him. 

I don't recall Tom Merton '38 very 
well, but our classmate Bob Lax, by 
virtue of alphabetical proximity, was 
quite close occasionally. When he was 
editor of fester he asked me to con¬ 
tribute. I did, once: a take-off on a stu¬ 
dent revolt which was never pub¬ 
lished. Mr. Nobbe liked it anyway. 

Mark Van Doren looked every inch 
an English professor in 1936 (or was it 
'37?). He also appeared the perfect New 
England poet. However, in those days 
he stood in the shadow of his brother, 
Carl, the historian, and his poetic repu¬ 
tation was somewhat eclipsed by that of 
Robert Frost, whose verse was some¬ 
what similar. 

Enough, without getting into the 
Quiz Show business.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Gorgeous Italian 

How satisfying it was to read in your 
Fall 1994 issue that Professor Maris- 
tella de Panizza Lorch received the 
Father Ford Award of Distinction. As 
the wife of a Columbia alumnus (Ed 
Gold '47, '48J), I had the privilege of 
attending Dean's Day when Professor 
Lorch lectured on Dante. 

It was a cold, sleety morning in Feb¬ 
ruary. How can I tell you how difficult 
it was to get up? I stumbled around 
the campus looking for the right 
building. Once there, I found many 
people crowding in, all astonished to 
see other people. Then came Professor 
Lorch, with xeroxed sheets of excerpts 
in Italian and English. We snatched at 
them greedily; there weren't enough 
to go around because the professor 
hadn't expected such a turnout. 

She began, "Let me tell you what a 
comedy is. It's a story that starts out 
badly and ends well." Then she began 
to read in her gorgeous Italian (I speak 
only a few words but I know gorgeous 
Italian when I hear it). The sedate- 
looking man sitting next to me wept 
silently. "I haven't heard anyone read 
like that since my mother read Dante 
to me," he whispered. The hour flew 
by before you could say "Vergil." 

Professor Lorch deserves lots of 
prizes, but it's nice that she got the 
Father Ford Award. He was a sweetie, 
too.

Ben lives 

I was very happy to read in the latest 
issue of Columbia College Today that Mr. 
Ben Jerman is alive and well. Your 
article brought back a lot of memories: 
I lived in Furnald Hall at about the 
time that Ben retired. 

Enclosed is a check in his honor.

Erratum 

In our report about Ben Jerman and 
Eurnald Hall [Around the Quads, 
Winter '95], we incorrectly spelled the 
name of Gerald Krovatin '74, who was 
mentioned along with his wife, Anna 
Quindlen B'74.

The Lion^s Den 

Flight to Hanoi 

After 20 years, the unreality of Vietnam becomes real. 

BY Paul A. Argenti '75 


T he spring of 1975 was one of the best times of my life. 
Our class was preparing to leave Columbia, and Viet¬ 
nam was finally fading from consciousness. Then we 
saw that incredible photograph of the helicopter on top of the 
American Embassy in Saigon. A marine leans over a long lad¬ 
der with people lined up trying desperately to get on the last 
flight out. 

I stared up at that roof from a Saigon street last December. 
Two drunks sat laughing in front of the tattered entrance to 
what was one of the largest State Department buildings in 
Asia. The trees swayed in a lovely tropical breeze. I wan¬ 
dered over to the old Presidential Palace just up the colonial 
French boulevard. At the entrance were photographs of the 
tanks headed up into the Palace—a contrast to the pictures 
we saw in the American newspapers. 

The Palace has been left the way it was in April 1975. 
Americans pay two dollars to sit in the helicopter that sits on 
the roof, helmets included. You can also drive out to the Cu 
Chi Tunnels, where the Vietcong hid for years underground. 
Americans pay one dollar to shoot rifles used during the war. 
An old woman served me tea after a horribly claustrophobic 
one-hour trek through the wartime burrows. I later found out 
that she had lived in that same passage for 15 years. 

T his past year, when 1 went to Vietnam twice with a 

group of American management specialists, my mind 
kept switching between the Vietnam my classmates 
and I thought about endlessly in college and the Vietnam 
that exists in reality today. 

Our class was unfortunate enough to be denied draft defer¬ 
ments; my lottery number came up an unlucky 14 in the 
spring of 1972. My cousin had died near Danang the previous 
year, just before he was to come home. I was definitely not 
excited about going to war and talked about my options with 
my college friends throughout the fall of 
1972. 

Canada was totally out of the question. 

The National Guard beckoned with its 
commitment for six years and many sum¬ 
mers playing soldier. Becoming a conscien¬ 
tious objector was never really an option. 

Eating myself into obesity with the help of 
Mama Joy's was the idea we decided 
upon. Spectator ran an article that fall 
about one of our classmates who was 
stuck in battle while we pondered the 
mysteries of the Trojan War. Around 
Thanksgiving, I went to my pre-induction 
Army physical pondering my choices and 
longing for some kind of reprieve. 

Twenty years later, as I traveled through 
Danang on my first trip to Vietnam, I came 
across the old American air base, which is 
bigger than O'Hare Airport. It sits empty 


now, a sad and bewildering site. My wife and I stayed on 
China Beach, right next to a landing strip. I spent several 
hours alone on the beach wondering what it would have been 
like to be there during the war. The shared experience for our 
generation was protesting the war, and yet I now felt as if I 
had missed something. The phantom sound of attack planes 
and helicopters is deafening at China Beach—visions of Apoc- 
alyspe Now. I thought about my cousin dying only a few miles 
away. It allowed me to grieve for him for the first time in two 
decades. 

I was given my reprieve when President Nixon ended the 
draft just before Christmas of 1972.1 swore off Mama Joy's 
liverwurst for life. We went on, the conflict again an intellec¬ 
tual problem rather than a physical one. Jane Fonda visited 
Riverside Church the next spring and showed photographs 
of war atrocities. I remember thinking how lucky I was that 
the draft had ended and how unfortunate the people of Viet¬ 
nam were. 

I never dreamed that I would someday be traveling to 
Vietnam to teach bureaucrats and academics about American 
business. Our seminar in Hanoi was held right next to the 
War Atrocities Museum; a picture of Ho Chi Minh looked 
over my shoulder as I lectured on the methods of capitalism. 
In Ho Chi Minh City, I walked through another war museum 
only to find pictures of Jane Fonda visiting back in 1973. 

But the eeriest sight came just before the museum exit. An 
American soldier, about my age, had donated his uniform to 
the museum a few months earlier. Underneath the uniform 
was a letter saying, "We were wrong. I am sorry." I couldn't 
control the tears and sat for an hour thinking about the war. 

can still hear the bells pealing from St. Paul's Chapel on a 
beautiful day in May 1975. We lined up for graduation 
knowing that the war was over; Nixon had resigned the 
year before. Columbia had been an inte¬ 
gral part of the anti-war movement for a 
decade. Our class was the last that would 
experience all of the tumult and emotion 
of that movement. 

Vietnam was never quite real to me 
then. I'm not sure it is now, even though I 
have been there twice and have pictures 
and memories of that beautiful country. 
Those of us who came of age during the 
war and fought against it rather than in it 
will never be able to face the reality of 
Vietnam today without remembering 
what it meant to us then.

A long shelf-life 

This weekend I read your Winter Van 
Doren issue, from cover to cover. A bril¬ 
liant and very satisfpng experience. 

Now 1 wish 1 had been reading all your 
issues so thoroughly. CCT is unquestion¬ 
ably among the very best of the dozens 
of magazines 1 get, including the major 
books. 1 admire your talent and consis¬ 
tency. Thanks for giving your readers, or 
at least this one, so much pleasure.

Conditional support 

Jamie Katz's recent article, "The Win¬ 
ning Formula" [Roar Lion Roar, Winter 
1995], described the turnaround of the 
Columbia football program. All those 
who helped to make the team relatively 
successful are to be congratulated. 

However, as a long-suffering alumnus, 

1 wish to advise the athletic department 
that it appears that efforts to improve the 
football program were balanced by allow¬ 
ing the basketball program to deteriorate 
seriously (the team won aU of four games 
last season). 

1 will therefore withhold my financial 
support until the athletic department 
adopts the following policy with respect 
to all major sports: 

(1) Recruit so that the team is com¬ 
petitive, or, 

(2) Downsize the scheduling of oppo¬ 
nents so that the team can play competi¬ 
tively, or, 

(3) Terminate intercollegiate competi¬ 
tion in that sport.

Original Columbia 
Jazz Band 

In his article on Pat Zimmerli '90, 
"Columbia's new jazz adventurer" 
[Spring/Summer 1995 CCT ], Lee 
Lowenfish '63 suggests that the Colum¬ 
bia Jazz Band was founded in the late 
1980's under the tutelage of Don Sickler, 
the gifted trumpeter and arranger. As a 
member of the Jazz Band from 1982 to 
1986,1 can attest that this is not true. 

According to fellow alumni, the Jazz 
Band has existed from as early as 1976, 
when a group of students approached 


THE Editor 


Don Hahn and asked him to be its 
director. Mr. Hahn, an excellent musi¬ 
cian who has held the trumpet chair in 
the Buddy Rich and Maynard Ferguson 
big bands, led the Columbia Jazz Band 
from 1976 to 1986. Under his direction, 
the band gave impressive and well- 
received performances annually at the 
Ivy League Jazz Festival. 1 personally 
recall the 1985 festival at Yale where, 
because of our reputation as a formida¬ 
ble band with a strong "straight ahead 
be-bop" repertoire, we were asked to 
perform last. 

If my memory is correct, Don Sickler 
took the reins of the Columbia Jazz 
Band in September 1986, during my last 
semester with the band. Mr. Sickler has 
made great contributions to the Jazz 
Band and should be applauded for his 
efforts. Lee's article has now prompted 
me to try to determine if the Columbia 
Jazz Band predates 1976. If other alum¬ 
ni have any information about the ori¬ 
gin and history of the Columbia Jazz 
Band, I'd love to hear about it.

Football vs. education 

It was the late 1940's. The University of 
Chicago's Robert Maynard Hutchins, 
having directed that institution for two 
decades, was now stepping down, deliv¬ 
ering his final address: "The great task of 
the clarification," he raged, "is not made 
easier by extra-curriculum activities!" 

I'm quoting from memory, but I'm 
close—perhaps his rhetoric took its tone 
from the weather. In any case, his allu¬ 
sion was lost on no one. Some ten years 
earlier, after a series of losses that tend¬ 
ed to be, as he put it, "murderous," and 
to considerable clamor and surprise. Dr. 
Hutchins had disbanded his college's 
football team. I have a quarrel with his 
timing and with part of his rationale, 
but I think he was prescient in realizing 
that football and higher education are 
incompatible, and brave to act on that 
conviction under any pretext. 

Most of us who are applauding the 
Columbia football team's great victories 
this fall—as I write, they have a real shot 
at the Ivy title—remember that we were 
in a similar situation just a few years ago. 
The worst thing about The Streak, which 
ended when I was an undergraduate, 
was not the damage it did to Columbia's 
reputation (negligible, in my opinion) but

the effects it had on a large part of the 
student body. The team's chronic losing 
was not, everyone agreed, a good educa¬ 
tional experience for them. It wasn't good 
for anyone when fellow students reacted 
to their failures by cheering. The proper 
response to failure is to confront and 
overcome it. Coach TeUier and his players 
deserve credit for having done so; I think 
it was wrong for Dr. Hutchins to have 
used losing as his excuse. 

However, the current success of 
Columbia football gives President Rupp 
the perfect chance to reevaluate the 
desirability of our program without fear 
of naisunderstanding. Losing is not the 
problem with college football: the prob¬ 
lem is its deleterious effect on under¬ 
graduate education. By abolishing foot¬ 
ball, President Rupp would immediately 
make Columbia a better place. 

It's not fair to dismiss out of hand the 
claim that football can be a valuable part 
of an undergraduate education. When 
true to the spirit of amateur sports, foot¬ 
ball can teach discipline, teamwork, loy¬ 
alty and endurance without significantly 
detracting from the intellectual experi¬ 
ence that must be any college's true mis¬ 
sion. But it would be naive to believe 
that this is why so many schools devote 
such a great portion of their resources to 
the sport. To be competitive at the Divi¬ 
sion 1 level, even Ivy League colleges are 
forced to violate this spirit. The league's 
efforts to avoid the obvious corruption 
of big football schools like Miami or 
Nebraska are admirable, but inevitably 
insufficient, unavoidably compromised. 

Consider for example the fact that 
Columbia has recently begun recruiting 
players from junior colleges, and that 
the league has recently ended its ban on 
spring practice. Both policies are uncon¬ 
vincingly defended on their own merits. 
The real motivation behind such choic¬ 
es, and the goal pervading the program 
generally, is simply winning. For foot¬ 
ball programs exist not to educate but 
to raise funds; their purpose is to spur 
us, the alumni, to greater giving. Is the 
effort worth it? That depends on how 
detrimental one thinks football really is 
to education, and on how much money 
(presumably directed towards educa¬ 
tion) it actually brings in. 

In my view, football detracts from 
education at Columbia in two ways. 
First, it hinders the players themselves 
from their own pursuit of clarification 
by making enormous demands on their 
time and energy. (So do other extracur¬ 
ricular activities: Dr. Hutchins was right. 


Jubilation: Fans and players swarmed onto the field on October 7 after the Lions snapped 
Penn's 24-game winning streak and vaulted into Ivy contention by topping the league's 
defending champions, 24-14. photo; nick romanenko 


I think, to value scholarship over all 
other campus activities.) Countering 
this. I've often heard the argument made 
that it is football that gives many kids 
their chance at an Ivy League education 
in the first place. True enough, and for 
those student athletes who take advan¬ 
tage of that opportunity in spite of the 
onerous requirements of the team, I 
have nothing but admiration. This argu¬ 
ment, however, begs the second criti¬ 
cism of the program: that despite the 
league's policy prohibiting athletic 
scholarships, football skills are given 
disproportionate weight over other sorts 
by the admissions staff. Again, the same 
could fairly be said about other groups 
of students, from baseball players to 


musicians; but along with legacies, the 
football program probably exerts the 
most pressure numerically. 

Certainly there are many football 
players who deserve to be at Columbia 
solely on their intellectual merits. But 
about six percent of the males in each 
class at the College come to play foot¬ 
ball—a huge figure, to my mind—and it 
is simply evident that some of these 
people fail to meet the intellectual and 
academic standards of the rest of the 
student body. A visit to almost any class¬ 
room or bar on Morningside Heights 
will confirm that there are kids with 
truly promising minds being denied 
admission in favor of passably smart 
jocks. Nothing could be more flagrantly

opposed to the College's true purpose. 

Can the University then afford to do 
away with the team? 1 don't know the 
answer, but 1 suspect it can. Columbia 
is a remarkable institution, quite differ¬ 
ent from most American universities. 
Our greatest legacy is a tradition of the 
most serious and exciting intellectual- 
ism, tempered by the historical combi¬ 
nation of a metrophile student body 
and professorial commitment to a core 
curriculum. 1 believe it is this legacy 
that prompts our alumni to give, much 
more than the entertainment of win¬ 
ning football; to the extent these goals 
are seen as opposed, football actually 
acts as a brake on alumni giving. And 
this view is supported, 1 think, by the 
Univiversity of Chicago's example: it is 
probably the institution most like 
Columbia, and it has thrived without 
football. (Actually, Chicago seems to 
have achieved the best of both worlds: 
after a long hiatus, it restored football 
at the Division 111 level, where competi¬ 
tive football and true amateurism are 
still not incompatible.) 

Columbia's new leadership, and the 
new priority given to undergraduate 


academic excellence by President Rupp, 
combined with the happy fact of the 
Lions' recent success, all offer the perfect 
opportunity to rethink our need for a 
football team. In an open letter to Presi¬ 
dent Rupp along these lines that was 
recently printed in Spectator, I made it 
clear that my financial support of the 
University would be contingent, not on 
the team's success, but on its disbanding. 
I hope other alumni who feel similarly 
will also make their positions known.

Reunion reaction 

I cannot let our Reunion Weekend in 
June go by without saying how much 
my wife, Nancy, and I enjoyed our 40th. 
We truly had a great time. It was very 
nostalgic and, although I live close by 
the campus and visit during the year, it 
was a special feeling to see all of my 
classmates, from all over the United 
States, gathered together again. 

I write to share three notions that 
became very clear to me over the 
weekend: 

1) The new Dean of the College is a 


wonderful choice. I think Dean Quigley 
will be an active, involved, and dedicat¬ 
ed Dean who will add a lot to the Col¬ 
lege and do what is necessary to rebuild 
alumni interest and support. 

2) There were so many members of 
my class who felt that their entire lives 
were changed and made more mean¬ 
ingful because of their association with 
classmates and the College. I found the 
speakers truly amazing to listen to as 
they recounted their accomplishments 
and contributions to society. I was in 
awe of many of my peers! 

3) The wonderful weekend that we all 
enjoyed would not have been possible 
were it not for Jerry Sherwin, our Class 
President. We in the Class of '55 believe 
he is probably the best president of any 
class. Because of him, so many of us 
were there and, because of him, every¬ 
thing was very special. I wanted to pub¬ 
licly express my gratitude and that of 
my classmates to Jerry for all his efforts. 

Thank you for your wonderful 
publication.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 


Mixed emotions 

I was not too happy reading "Right To 
Hanoi" by Paul Argenti '75 [The Lion's 
Den, Spring/Sununer 1995]. It is nothing 
more than a self-serving diatribe written 
by one individual reflecting on his 
thoughts and actions as they relate to 
Vietnam over the past twenty-something 
^ears. As such it contains a number of 
inaccuracies and should definitely not be 
regarded as representative of an entire 
generation of Columbia College graduates. 

The Columbia Naval ROTC program 
was still very much alive and well in the 
early 1960's when 1 was seeking entrance 
into the Marine Corps' PLC program. It 
was the direct intervention of the ROTC 
department head at the time (a Marine 
colonel) that secured that entrance for 
me. After graduation in June 1964 and 
eight months of training as a Marine 
combat engineer officer, 1 served in the 
Danang area of South Vietnam for 19 
months with the Third Marine Division. 
My only regret from that period has 
been that 1 did not stay in the Marine 
Corps long enough to have gone back 
for a second and perhaps a third tour. 

Mr. Argenti cites a well known 1975 
photograph of the American Embassy 
in Saigon. The helicopter in that photo¬ 
graph is an Air America "Huey," and 
the man leaning over the ladder is not a 
Marine but most probably a CIA officer 
(operators of Air America). The Ameri¬ 
can air base at Danang may indeed now 
sit empty, but in 1965-66, when our 
engineer battalion was located within a 
mile of the airfield, it thrived with activ¬ 
ity. Air Force F-lOO Super Sabres that 
struck at North Vietnam and B-57 Can- 
berras, used to interdict the Ho Chi 
Minh Trail, shared the ramp along with 
Marine F-4 Phantoms that provided 
ground support for infantry units, to 
mention just a few examples. 

On his most recent visit to Vietnam, Mr. 
Argenti stayed at China Beach with his 
wife and wondered what it was like there 
during the war. My trips to the China 
Beach area were usually taken to visit 
combat casualties suffered by our battal¬ 
ion, many of whom did not survive. A lot 
of men 1 knew and served with died not 
too many miles from Danang, and it did 
not take us two decades before we grieved 
for them. In 1966 the soimd of attack air¬ 
craft flying from Danang and helicopters 
operating from Marble Mountain, not too 
far away, was indeed deafening. 

I can imagine Jane Fonda visiting 
Riverside Church to show photographs

Getting the news out 


C olumbia College Today has pub¬ 
lished continuously for 41 
years and has several times 
been honored as the nation's finest 
alumni magazine. It therefore came 
as a surprise to pick up The Wall 
Street Journal in August and read that 
Columbia does not have an alumni 
magazine. 

In fact, Columbia, like several of 
the Ivy universities discussed in the 
Journal piece, has more than one. A 
later correction noted that it was 
non-membership in the Ivy advertis¬ 
ing group, as opposed to non-exis¬ 
tence, that the paper meant to report. 

Not surprisingly, when the item 
appeared, we heard from a number 
of readers. 

College alumni regard 
CCT with a proprietary 
spirit. An independently 
conducted readers' sur¬ 
vey last year gave CCT a 
resoimding vote of con¬ 
fidence: alumni read the 
magazine intensively, 
they enjoy it, and it 
makes them more hkely 
to contribute. Thousands 
respond to our annual appeal for 
voluntary subscriptions. 

All the same, the feeling persists— 
and we share it—that we could be 
doing much more. This view is usu¬ 
ally expressed supportively, some¬ 
times scaldingly. At a time of austeri¬ 
ty, there are choices to be made: 
Should we trade off editorial quality 
and depth for greater frequency? In 
our survey, 60 percent of alumni 
indicated they preferred about the 
same number and size of issues they 
were then receiving; 30 percent 
voted for a more frequent publica¬ 
tion with the current range of con¬ 
tents; and only 4 percent endorsed 
the idea of a more streamlined prod¬ 
uct that comes out much more fre¬ 
quently. The survey was conducted, 
by the way, before we stepped up to 
three issues a year, supplemented by 
the newsletter, Columbia College Cur¬ 
rent. Full-time staff remains steady at 
two. 


As our new strategy unfolds, we 
will rely on your continuing 
thoughtful support and interest. 

A s this issue was going to bed, 
the nation's racial problems 
flared on campus in an ugly 
way when the Spectator published an 
openly anti-Semitic op-ed column 
written by a black student leader. 
Many students and alumni have 
expressed outrage, lawsuits have 
been promised, donations have been 
withheld, and the student columnist 
has reported death threats. The con¬ 
troversy has received full coverage in 
The New York Times and elsewhere. 
After the Columbia administration 
issued a statement 
deploring the article 
while defending Specta¬ 
tor's right to publish it. 
College Dean Austin 
Quigley addressed a 
letter to students that 
went further, saying a 
free society's fragile 
sense of community 
depends on responsible 
expression, not just 
open expression. "Students under¬ 
stand this very well and the Univer¬ 
sity has conventions that try to bal¬ 
ance rights and responsibilities in the 
opinions we express and the ways in 
which we express them," he wrote. 

"We all recognize, for example, 
that there should be no place in our 
community for racist, sexist, homo- 
phobic, or anti-Semitic remarks." 

His two-page, single-spaced letter 
concluded with an appeal: "1 hope 
we will all find in the current situa¬ 
tion reasons to redouble our efforts 
to promote the kind of community 
of which we can all, and 1 do mean 
all, feel justifiably proud."

Columbia College Today 


Around 
the Quads 



"If I were a stranger here, wal 


Tossed in quickly 


Ask him how things have gone since he arrived in Hamilton 
Hall in August, and College Dean Austin Quigley responds with 
a Joycean torrent of thoughts and feelings. Running a college, he 
has discovered, is not just a mandate to pursue large educational 
goals, it's also "a series of rapid, 
speedy and urgent encounters," a 
relentless procession of people 
and problems, all needing his 
personal attention. 

"I think what tends to happen 
in your first few weeks as Dean is 
that you have an awful lot of peo¬ 
ple that you have to get to know," 
he says in a machine-gun paced 
British accent. "You've got an 
awful lot of activities that need 
some input from the Dean. 1 think 
an awful lot of your time goes 
into simply reacting to everything 
that comes in the door. There is 
much less time than you would 

wish to actually take major initiatives and to start direct¬ 
ing things with any global perspective." 

Despite his disclaimer, the 52-year-old scholar of mod¬ 
ern drama has moved energetically to establish his lead¬ 
ership among the several College constituencies—stu¬ 
dents, faculty, alumni, parents, and fellow academic 
administrators. 

At a time of continuing tight budgets and apprehen¬ 
sion over proposed government cutbacks in student aid 
and faculty research, he is giving highest priority to 
improving student services and facilities, nourishing and 
sustaining the core curriculum, linking alumni and facul¬ 
ty more closely to students as mentors and advisors, and 
upholding the College's commitment to need-blind 
admissions and full-need financial aid. 

College alumni can feel confident about the quaUty of 
leadership in the University today, Mr. Quigley believes. "I 
think George Rupp deserves an enormous amount of cred¬ 
it for what he's been able to achieve in the last couple of 
years," he says. "I think he recognized from the outset that 
empty rhetoric and grand dreams weren't going to carry 
him very far in a very sophisticated environment. And he 
made it clear that there's a collective responsibility here, 
and there is no magic wand waved by the president." 

With the new administration, even some familiar 
questions are being addressed with fresh eyes. Take, for 
example, the College's place within the University. To 
Dean Quigley this is, among other things, a problem of 
campus design. 

"This institution, while architecturally beautiful, tends 


not to break down into units that are very visible to anyone com¬ 
ing in from the outside," he says. As part of the extensive reno¬ 
vations now under way on the Morningside campus, he notes 
approvingly, the University has added a number of attractive 
signs to help visitors find their way. 

But the College needs something more visible than new sig¬ 
nage to announce its existence. 

"If I were a stranger here, walk¬ 
ing in from Broadway, I wouldn't 
have any idea where the College 
was," he notes, "and even the 
people who know where it is 
don't have any signals around to 
show that it has a physical pres¬ 
ence in the University." 

The first heralding of this new 
visibility, proposed by Dean 
Quigley and immediately accept¬ 
ed by Low Library, has been the 
erection of a towering triad of 
flagpoles on the east side of 
South Field, in front of Van 
Amringe Quadrangle. Light blue- 


Tradition and the 
individual talent: 

Dean Austin Quigley is 
keen on the College's his¬ 
toric identity. To help 
proclaim the school's 
physical presence on 
campus, he has erected 
three flagpoles on South 
Field in front of Van 
Amringe Quadrangle.

and-white Columbia flaggage is being specially devised to pro¬ 
claim the College's new pride. And further modifications to the 
lobby and environs of Hamilton Hall will almost certainly follow, 
including a possible repositioning of the historic black wrought- 
iron gate near Hamilton, dedicated to former New York Mayor 
Abram S. Hewitt (Class of 1842), which is said to be the only sur¬ 
viving structure from the College's 49th Street campus. 

Under Mr. Quigley's predecessor, Steven Marcus '48, the Col¬ 
lege deanship was fused with the vice presidency of Arts and Sci¬ 
ences. Now that the positions have been uncoupled, it is fair to 
ask about the quality of collaboration with David Cohen, the new 
vice president. Dean Quigley responds, "The Arts and Sciences 
and the College are clearly locked together institutionally, and we 
” are trying to maximize the relationship for both sides of the equa¬ 

tion. It seems to me we've evolved the appropriate degree of 
autonomy on both sides, and the appropriate degree of teamwork. 
I feel very comfortable with the relationship that we're develop¬ 
ing, and I think we both have very similar goals." 

One setback, early in their term, has been Columbia's sinking 
from ninth to 15th ranking in this year's U.S. News & World Report 
survey of "America's Best Colleges." The drop is almost entirely 
due, in statistical terms, to a change in the reported graduation 
rate of Columbia students: with transfers now excluded, that rate 
is now 89 percent, and this year's survey also gives this fact 
greater weight in its calculations. Close readers of the study will 
note that among the 10 or 11 schools just below the top five (Har¬ 
vard, Princeton, Yale, Stanford and M.I.T.), the marginal differ¬ 
ences are pretty tiny. 

"An awful lot of shift in the ranking can occur from a very 
small shift in the data," Dean Quigley observes. "If they used the 
same statistical method each year, they would get the same results 
every year, and they wouldn't sell as many magazines. There's 
nothing false about that, they're just reporting on a slightly differ¬ 
ent reality each year. In fact, universities don't change that much 
from year to year." 

However, he's not taking the U.S. News ranking lightly, 
acknowledging, "The public relations of an institution are a very 
important part of institutional life and how we present ourselves 
to the world." On the other hand, he emphasizes, "We should 
have our own standards of excellence and pursue them with 
determination and thoroughness and ambition, and satisfy our¬ 
selves that we are where we want to be. That's our first priority." 

Dean Quigley maintains a jam-packed schedule—his typical 
day has him committed from nine a.m. to nine p.m. and beyond— 
and he's still teaching one course this term. But the former soccer 
star is keeping up his daily half-hour run in Riverside Park each 
morning, and he appears mobilized by his new responsibilities. 
After all, he's from rugged Northumberland stock, he reminds us. 
When the Roman Empire reached that part of the world—"where 
the sky sits very low and it rains a lot and it feels like it's inhabit- 
I ed by ghosts," he says—the vaunted legions simply gave up. 

"They just built a wall and went no further." 

"People are so tough up there," he boasts, with a twinkle in his 
eye, "that when you speak to them and they like what you say— 
they really like what you say—they register their approval by let¬ 
ting you live." 

With that in mind, it must have come as a gratifying surprise to 
Mr. Quigley that when he concluded his first report to the College 
i faculty, he received an unusual tribute for an incoming dean: They 

gave him an ovation.

Not one, but 
two chairmen 
of the trustees 
are named 

The New York 
real estate 
developer and 
civic leader 
Jerry 1. Speyer 
'62 has been 
elected as the 
26th chairman 
of the University's Board of 
Trustees. At the same time that 
the decision was made in Sep 
tember, it was also annoimced 
that Lionel 1. Pincus, a leading 
venture capitahst, would succeed 
him in 1996, with the imprece- 
dented understanding that they 
would share many of the respon¬ 
sibilities of the chairmanship 
during each other's terms. 

Mr. Speyer is president and 
CEO of Tishman Speyer Proper¬ 
ties, which has developed or 
acquired some $5 billion worth 
of property and manages 15 
million square feet of commer¬ 
cial space, primarily in Manhat¬ 
tan. Outside New York, the firm 
is developing Europe's tallest 
skyscraper—the Messeturm, in 
Erankfurt—and the Sony head¬ 
quarters bulding in Berlin. A 
former director of the Alumni 
Association and vice chairman 
of the College Eund, Mr. Speyer 
has held leadership roles with 
many civic, cultural, and educa¬ 
tional institutions, among them 
the Museum of Modern Art, the 
Council on Eoreign Relations, 
the Dalton School, and the Real 
Estate Board of New York. 

Mr. Pincus, who received his 
MBA from the Business School 
in 1956, is chairman and chief 
executive of E.M. Warburg, Pin¬ 
cus & Co., a financial services 
group. He is a founding direc¬ 
tor of the National Venture 
Capital Association and a for¬ 
mer trustee of the General Mar¬ 
shall Eund of the United States.

But course registration—a three- 
day ordeal largely spent on line 
in a hot gym—^is rarely the sub¬ 
ject of nostalgic reflection. 

This year, however, the 
process has slimmed down to a 
mere phone call. With a green 
light from their advisors, 
Columbia College students can 
now complete an entire regis¬ 
tration session from any touch- 
tone telephone, anywhere in 
the country. 

Columbia is only the second 
school in the Ivy League to 
institute such a system. The 
University of Pennsylvania has 
been using phone registration 


The three day ordeal 
of registration can 
now be handled 
with a single call. 

for at least three years. Unlike 
their Penn counterparts, howev¬ 
er, students at Columbia are 
able to get an instant response 
to their selections when they 
attempt to register. Eor example, 
if a phys. ed. or Lit Hum section 
is full, the system will offer the 
caUer another available section 
for the same time slot. 

This new convenience comes 
as a surprise to many alumni, 
who generally experienced reg¬ 
istration as a journey through a 
specially devised circle of 
Dante's hell. "We waited," 
remembers Ralph Schoenstein 
'53. "It was confusing. You 
were nervous about whether a 
class would be open, and you 
certainly needed patience. I 
didn't have it." 

In the old days, the registrar 
and bursar would move their 
entire staffs to the gym. The 
process was time-consuming 
and costly, since it required a 
battalion of temporary workers 
for set-up and operation. Stu¬ 
dents endured four different 
registration rounds—few can 
remember why. It usually took 
days to find out the results of 
one's course requests. After 
that, the registrar was barraged 
with drops and adds. 

The new phone registration 
system began to develop under 













AROUND THE QUADS 


Columbia College Today 


University Registrar Joseph 
Capobianco in 1990. In January 
1992, the Lion's Den in Ferris 
Booth Hall became the transi¬ 
tional location for registration. 
Nathaniel Daw '96 remembers 
it well. "When I was a fresh¬ 
man, they used computers," he 
said, "but I still stood in line 
for three hours." 

After the new system had a 
successful first trial in the 
School of Social Work, the Col¬ 
lege instituted partial telephone 
registration in the fall of 1993, 
for limited-enrollment and core 
classes. Last April, the process 
became completely automated. 
Registration now begins earlier, 
shortly after midterm exams for 
the following semester. This 
forces many students to plan 
ahead more than they would 
like to, and is a source of some 
complaining. There is also a 
period at the beginning of each 
semester for students to read¬ 
just their final schedules. 

The telephone system is able 
to inform students whether they 
have any registration "holds," 
which used to be caused by 
something as simple as an 
unpaid library fine. Holds have 
since been reduced to three 
major categories: debt of over 
$2500; failure to comply with 
state regulations for measles, 
mumps and rubella; or unsatis¬ 
factory academic progress. 

"We've been fine-tuning the 
program," says Associate Reg¬ 
istrar Marguerite Nelson. "We 
tried to make everything work 
together. We redesigned the 
materials to be easier to use." 
Mr. Capobianco adds, "In the 
old days, it was first-come, 
first-served. No appointments. 
People would come in several 
times in one day." 

Now, he says, the average 
call takes slightly under two 
minutes.

■ DEDICATION: Peter J. Awn, 
Professor of Religion, has 
received the 1995 Great Teacher 
Award of the Society of Colum¬ 
bia Graduates. 

"You embody the true spirit 
of the Gollege's half-century-old 
Literature Humanities course," 


read the citation in part, "show¬ 
ing the newest members of 
academe that long-dead poets 
live, that Homer's theater is 
before their eyes. A witty and 
compelling lecturer, you also lis¬ 
ten intently, giving the impres¬ 
sion that knowledge is there 
inside each student, needing 
only your questioning to elicit." 

Professor Awn, a Harvard 
Ph.D. and a specialist in 
Sufism, has taught at Golumbia 
since 1978. A former chairman 
of the religion department, he 
is currently director of the 



Joseph Rothschild '51 


Undergraduate Program in 
Religion. He is a frequent con¬ 
sultant on Muslim affairs to 
corporations, private organiza¬ 
tions, and the major media. 

The award was presented at a 
dinner at Faculty House on Octo¬ 
ber 19. Also honored at the cere¬ 
mony was Professor of Apphed 
Physics Thomas C. Marshall of 
the Engineering School, an 
expert in free electron lasers. 

■ CORE SERVICE: Class of 1919 
Professor of Political Science 
Joseph Rothschild '51 has been 
presented with Columbia's 
third annual award for distin¬ 
guished service to the core cur¬ 
riculum. 

A former chairman of the 
departments of political science 
and government. Professor 
Rothschild has long dedicated 
his teaching energies and lead¬ 
ership to the College's Contem¬ 
porary Civilization program: in 
addition to teaching the course 
for more than three decades, he 
has chaired the department and 
co-edited the third edition of the 
C.C. source book. An authority 


on East Central Europe and the 
author of numerous scholarly 
publications, he is a member of 
the Academy of Political Science 
and the American Associaton 
for the Advancement of Slavic 
Studies, and a recipient of 
Columbia's Great Teacher 
Award (1978) and the Mark Van 
Doren Award (1991). 

Mr. Rothschild received his 
award at a reception at Faculty 
House on October 11. "I 
thought it [the ceremony] really 
captured him," his wife, Ruth, 
told Spectator. "No flattery, no 
pablum. It was really and truly 
to the point, and I think the 
award is well-merited, even 
though he's my husband." 

■ laureate: Martin L. Perl, 
who earned his Ph.D. from 
Columbia in 1955, has been 
named co-winner of the 1995 
Nobel Prize in Physics, bringing 
to 55 the number of Nobel win¬ 
ners who have taught or stud¬ 
ied at the University. Dr. Perl 
was cited for his 1975 discovery 
of the tau lepton, a superheavy 
cousin of the electron with a life 
of a trillionth of a second. 

Recalling his days as a grad¬ 
uate student. Dr. Perl credited 
the inspiration of Columbia 
professors Polykarp Kusch and 
1.1. Rabi, themselves Nobel 
laureates. "The first thing 
[Rabi] taught me was, don't do 
what other people do. The 
other crucial thing about him 
was that he was never very 
good in math, but he was able 
to do great research. That gave 
me the courage, if you will, that 
I could do similar things. 

"Finally, he taught me that it 
was good to be first, but better 
to be right." 

Chairman of the faculty at the 
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen¬ 
ter, Dr. Perl previously taught at 
the University of Michigan and 
is a member of the National 
Academy of Sciences and the 
American Physical Society.

■ ASCENT OF man: New evi¬ 
dence, in the form of correla¬ 
tions between the fossil record 
and ocean sediments, bolsters 
the theory that human evolu¬ 
tion was profoundly altered by 


major climatological changes. 

Peter deMenocal, a paleoch- 
matologist at Columbia's Lam- 
ont-Doherty Earth Observatory, 
found that at significant moments 
of human evolution—^moments 
marked by the emergence of the 
immediate human ancestor Homo 
erectus and the extinction of the 
rival Paranthropus —ocean sedi¬ 
ments off certain African coasts 
showed greater amounts of soil 
particles and tiny remnants of 
grasses that had been blown out 
to sea. The increased presence of 
the matter, called eohan dust.

indicates the onset of longer, 
more severe periods of cold and 
dry weather. Such conditions 
would have progressively killed 
African rain forests and set the 
stage for grasslands, with species 
that could not adapt to the more 
open and arid conditions becom¬ 
ing extinct. 

Dr. deMenocal's findings 
were reported in the October 6 
issue of Science magazine.

■ OUTWARD BOUND: Led by 
Professor Emeritus of Physics 
Robert Novick, a joint team of 
U.S. and Russian scientists is 
building an X-ray polarimeter 
that is expected to be lofted 
into orbit by a Russian satellite 
late in 1996. Dubbed the "Spec- 
trum-X-Gamma" satellite mis¬ 
sion, the project was endorsed 
by NASA administrator Daniel 
Goldin and Yuri Koptev, direc¬ 
tor general of the Russian 
Space Agency. 

The new instrument, designed 
to study the polarization of X- 
rays from such distant radiation 
sources as neutron stars, black 
holes, and supernova remnants, 
will be launched as part of a 
two and one-half ton scientific 
payload aboard a Russian Pro¬ 
ton rocket. According to Associ¬ 
ate Professor of Physics Philip 
Kaaret, the role of the Russians 
was crucial: Western scientists 
could not secure space for the 
polarimeter on any American 
space mission. 

■ BREAKUP: Scientists at the 
University's Lamont-Doherty 
Earth Observatory have found 
evidence that one of the Earth's 
twelve great crustal plates is 
cracking in two. 

According to the scientists, 
systematically aligned cracks in 
the oceanic lithosphere indicate 
that the Indo-Australian Plate, 
on which Australia and India 
lie, appears to have broken 
apart just south of the Equator 
beneath the Indian Ocean. It is 
estimated that the process 
began eight million years ago, 
when the accumulated mass of 
the island continent and the 
peninsular subcontinent became 
so great that the plate buckled 
and broke under the stress. The 
land masses are now moving 
independently, with the Aus¬ 
tralian plate moving counter¬ 


clockwise in relation to the Indi¬ 
an plate. "In the Central Indian 
Ocean, nature is conducting a 
large-scale laboratory experi¬ 
ment for us," said Jeffrey Weis- 
sel, a member of the Lamont- 
Doherty research team. 

The scientists took their mea¬ 
surements of the Indian Ocean 
floor in 1986, aboard the observa¬ 
tory's research vessel the Robert 
D. Conrad, and in 1991, aboard 
the French research vessel Marion 
Dufresne. The findings appeared 
in a recent issue of Earth and 
Planetary Science Letters.

Nakashima Peace Altar is dedicated 

A wooden altar designed by the late George 
Nakashima, celebrating peace and commemorat¬ 
ing alumni who have died in war, was conse¬ 
crated in St. Paul's Chapel on October 18. The 
nine-foot structure is the gift of Special Service 
Professor Wm. Theodore de Bary '41 and his wife Fanny, both 
close friends of Mr. Nakashima, the noted woodworker, archi¬ 
tect and designer, who also designed and furnished Kent Hall's 
Student and Faculty Lounge and the Heyman Center at East 
Campus. Carved from a massive black walnut log, the altar is 
notable for its use of clamps that bridge the wood's natural frac¬ 
tures, representing the tenuous unity of a world split asunder. 

Speakers at the ceremony included Mr. de Bary, University 
President George Rupp, Provost Jonathan Cole '64, and former 
Trustee Edward Costikyan '47. Mr. Costikyan conveyed the greet¬ 
ings of Sen. Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, who paid tribute not only 
to those killed in war, but also to "those, tike George Nakashima, 
who experienced a different challenge to freedom—^internment 
camps of World War II—^but who did not become bitter nor turn 
away from America as they might have been expected to do—^and 
who went on to give this nation the best of their visions." 

Also speaking was Mira Nakashima Yamall, the sculptor's 
daughter. "George Nakashima believed in the 'Soul of a Tree'— 
that each tree had a message for mankind which needed to be 
expressed and understood," she said. "He beheved in saving 
trees from being cut up for small and trivial purposes... [and in] 
preserving the nat¬ 
ural forms with 
aU their 'imperfec¬ 
tions' while mak¬ 
ing them into use¬ 
ful objects which 
enrich men's lives." 

The Nakashima 
Peace Altar is on 
permanent display 
near the south 
wall of St. Paul's, 
which is open to 
the public from 10 
a.m. to 10 p.m. 

Sunday through 
Thursday, 10 a.m. 
to 1 a.m. on Friday, 
and noon to 1 a.m. 
on Saturday. 

Speakers at the ceremony noted that the altar dedication 
coincides with a newly launched effort to publicly acknowl¬ 
edge Columbia's war dead; the process is expected to culmi¬ 
nate next year when plaques bearing the names of alumni 
who lost their lives in the 20th century's major conflicts are 
dedicated on campus. An informal committee is at work on 
the project; participants include Arthur Weinstock '41, Joseph 
Coffee '41, Mr. Costikyan, Professor of History James Shenton 
'49, and Jack Arbolino '42, the educator and decorated World 
War II Marine veteran, whose Lion's Den column in the 
Spring 1995 issue of CCT helped inspire the current drive. 

The imdertaking is being subsidized by a campaign of free¬ 
will contributions, but committee members anticipate the most 
difficult phase will be the collating of the names of the deceased 
from Defense Department and University Registrar's records. 
Alumni of wartime classes are urged to supplement this research 
by sending their recollections of fallen classmates to James 
Lennon '43 at 631 Wayne Avenue, Haddonfield, N.J. 08033.

CAMPUS BULLETINS 

■ FRONTIERS OF KNOWLEDGE: 
Hoping to communicate the 
richness and diversity of Colum¬ 
bia's myriad areas of scholarly 
study the Provost's office has 
created a new quarterly maga¬ 
zine, llstC, which will critically 
examine issues and report on 
developments in research in the 
humanities, the social sciences, 
and the natural sciences. 

"It strives to show how par¬ 
ticular subjects of research may 
be dealt with very differently in 
various disciphnes, with differ¬ 
ent implications for the universi¬ 
ty itself and for society at large," 
said the magazine's executive 
editor, William A. Polf, Deputy 
Vice President for External Rela¬ 
tions and Strategic Programs at 
the Health Sciences campus. "It 
also will provide a forum in 
which Columbia faculty and 
researchers, together with col¬ 
leagues from elsewhere, can dis¬ 
cuss and debate the critical 
issues facing research universi¬ 
ties today," said Vice Provost 
Michael Crow. 

Edited by William Millard, 
21stC has already pubhshed two 
issues; among the subjects 
broached have been "Research 
and the Culture of Instrumental¬ 
ism" by Joshua Lederberg '44, 
adjunct professor of biological 
sciences and Nobel laureate in 
medicine; "Violence and the 
Media: The Wrong Controversy" 
by Lewis Cole '68, chairman of 
the film division in the School of 
the Arts; and "The Environment 
and Human Consciousness" by 
Don Melnick, Professor of 
Anthropology and Biological 
Sciences; Simon Schama, Old 
Dominion Professor of History; 
and Corliss Pearl, executive 
director of the International 
Wildlife Preservation Trust. 
Among the faculty advisors to 
the pubhcation are Hepburn 
Professor Emeritus of Economics 
Eli Ginzberg '31, University 
Professor Fritz Stem '46, Profes¬ 
sor of History David Rothman 
'58, and Professor of Biological 
Sciences Robert E. Pollack '61.

■ OVER here: Among U.S. 
universities with more than 
2,000 foreign students, Colum¬ 
bia ranked first in the nation for 
the percentage of such students 
enrolled, and seventh in total 
foreign student enrollment, 
according to a 1993-94 survey 
conducted by the Institute of 
International Education recent¬ 
ly published in the Chronicle of 
Higher Education Almanac. At 
the time of the survey, Colum¬ 
bia had 3,585 students from 
beyond U.S. shores, with their 
proportion of the University's 
student population constituting 
18.1 percent. Boston University, 
with 4,547, had the most for¬ 
eign students in the country. 

The University now 
leads the nation 
in percentage of 
foreign students. 

By far, the greatest number 
of students nationally are from 
Asia, with the top five feeder 
countries being China, Japan, 
Taiwan, India, and the Repub¬ 
lic of Korea, in that order. 

■ NORMALE SUP': To celebrate 
the bicentennial of its foimding, 
the Ecole Normale Superieure de 
la Rue d'Uhn of Paris, one of 
Prance's elite institutions of high¬ 
er learning, conducted a series of 
campus lectures and sympo¬ 
siums on October 5-7 in conjunc¬ 
tion with the Maison Prangaise. 
Among the participants in the 
"Franco-American Intellectual 
Exchanges in Science, History, 
Literary, Criticism, International 
Studies, and Philosophy" were 
Etienne Guyon, director of the 
Normale Sup' (as the school is 
familiarly known); Evan Gal¬ 
braith, former U.S. Ambassador 
to France; Andre Baeyens, the 
French Consul General to New 
York; Michael Riffaterre, Uiuver- 
sity Professor; Henri Mitterand,

The moment the Columbia identity becomes yours 


The Class of '99 found itself 
on unfamiliar ground when 
its incoming members 
arrived for Orientation in 
August, but most of them 
quickly managed to assimi¬ 
late. Once the back-breaking 
job of moving only the nec¬ 
essary creature comforts was 
over, the new students were 
indexed and tagged for easy 
identification. There fol¬ 
lowed several heady days of 
lectures about the history of 
the College, stern instruction 
in proper dorm conduct, 
and myriad parties that 
would, with luck, acquaint 
the undergraduates with 
lifelong friends. None of this 
was possible, however, until 
the quintessential coming- 
of-age moment between par¬ 
ent and child was worked 
through—when the good¬ 
byes were finally said.

dually, it's still 
there, but you'd hardly know it for all 
the activity. Since the spring, scaffolding 
has been ubiquitous, barricades have 
rerouted pedestrians all over, and South 
Field for a while resembled the trenches 
of the Western Front as underground 
pipework was laid. There have been few 
complaints about the disruption; after 
all, it's the inevitable result of the largest 
simultaneous concentration of capital 
development in the history of Colum¬ 
bia—occuring just as the campus pre¬ 
pares to observe the 100th anniversary 
of the move to Morningside Heights 
next year. 

Heading the list of the more intensive 
ongoing projects is a $10 million expan¬ 
sion of the Law School to add about 7,500 
square feet of new space; a $12 million 
modernization of Furnald, which should 
be housing students again at the start of 
the ' 96-97 academic year; and $25 mil¬ 
lion in new heating, lighting, and air con¬ 
ditioning systems for Butler Library. 
Recently completed or nearing comple¬ 
tion are the total restoration of Casa Ital- 
iana to accommodate the new Italian 
Academy in America; a new $2 million 
exercise center in the old University Hall 
Gymnasium; and the installation of syn¬ 
thetic turf at Lawrence A. Wien Stadium. 

With future projects including an acad¬ 
emic building for the Business and Law 
Schools on 115th Street and Amsterdam 
Avenue and the much-heralded replace¬ 
ment of Ferris Booth Hall with a new stu¬ 
dent activities center, construction will, if 
anything, become even more ambitious 
as the millenium approaches. The noted 
architect Robert A. M. Stem '60, who 
chairs the Alumni Association's commit¬ 
tee on facilities, recently told board mem¬ 
bers as much, reminding them that the 
Butler renovations constitute only a first 
phase; "It'll be another $50 million before 
you see anything you like."

SENSE OF EVIL 


Columbia College Today 


''You've given up good and evil for 
behaviorism...nothing is ever anybody's 
fault. Look at me. Officer Starling. 

Can you stand to say I'm evil?" 

—HANNIBAL LECTER, IN THE SiLENCE OF THE LAMBS 


S ince every generation is inclined to 

believe that its own experience is without 
precedent, one of the rewards of looking 
into history is to discover that this is not 
so. In the aftermath of the Civil War, for 
instance, one finds Whitman complaining 
that ''the men believe not in the women, 
nor the women in the men," and that "the 
aim of all the litterateurs is to find some¬ 
thing to make fun of." These sentences— 
eerily apt for our own time—suggest that irony tends to surge 
in periods of retrenchment, after a culture has exerted itself on 
behalf of old pieties and paid the cost in blood and hope. (One 


of the first, and bitterest, effusions of 
post-Vietnam irony was Robert Alt¬ 
man's film M*A*S*H* [1970], which 
became a long-running television show 
in which the one-liner rhythm of the sit¬ 
com is transposed to a jungle field hos¬ 
pital.) "Irony," as Hayden White puts it, 
"represents the passage of the age of 
heroes and of the capacity to believe in 
heroism." 

If one scrolls through the history of 
American culture, a few ironic voices do 
emerge before the 20th century above 
the din of consensual piety. But they

leap from the page because of their rari¬ 
ty, as when an intellectual gadfly named 
Abner Kneeland gave vent to irony in 
the 1830's (contemporaries compared 
him to "beer from a bottle, all foaming") 
and found himself hauled in for trial on 
the charge of blasphemy. "A Parisian," 
he wrote, 

will be surprised to hear that the Hot¬ 
tentots cut out one of the testicles of 
every little boy; and a Hottentot will be 
surprised to hear that the Parisians 
leave every little boy two. Neither the 
Parisian nor the Hottentot is astonished 
at the practice of the other because he 
finds it unreasonable, but because he 
finds it different from his own. 


This man believed precociously, as we 
now do conventionally, that history is 
nothing more than a chain of contingen¬ 
cies. He was a modern before his time. If 
in one country httle boys are permitted 
to keep their genitals intact and in anoth¬ 
er they are subjected to testicular exci¬ 
sion, this is because they have come acci¬ 
dentally into the world at different times 
and places—not because there is any¬ 
thing intrinsically better about having 
one testicle or two. In country A, tamper¬ 
ing vHth the genitals is denounced as 
mutilation. In country B it is an affront to 
God for a child to keep his scrotum 
intact. To condemn or approve either 
view is to proclaim oneself a provin¬ 
cial—a person imprisoned in the preva¬ 
lent stories of one's own time and place. 
When Kneeland expressed these opin¬ 
ions, he was being deliberately scan¬ 
dalous; but today he would be consid¬ 
ered just another cultural relativist—one 
of the many who regard all past doc¬ 
trines as a series of universal claims for 
local practices. Once this judgment is 
made, there is no longer any scripture to 
which the missionary may turn when he 
wants to bring light to the savages. 
Indeed, there are no more Christians and 
no more savages. 

Yet if there are historical analogies for 
our situation ("genuine belief has left 
us," Whitman wrote in 1870), the tri¬ 
umph of irony has never been as com¬ 
plete as it is today. We have reached a

SENSE OF EVIL 


Columbia College Today 


The most articulate ironists of the last 
few years have not been professors but 
killers like the Menendez brothers— 
persons who variously identify some 
compulsion originating outside them¬ 
selves as the initiator of their actions. 


point where it is not only specific 
objects of belief that have been discred¬ 
ited but the very capacity to believe. 

This is new. In the past, when old ways 
of seeing the world gave way, it was 
possible to discern at least the outlines 
of a new way that would take their 
place; and the succession, it was gener¬ 
ally believed, would result in a better 
vision of truth. (This is what happened 
at the end of the 17th century, for 
instance, when the idea of possession 
by ghosts gave way to associationist 
psychology. It happened again in the 
19th century, when the doctrine of 
divine creation was replaced by the idea 
of evolution.) But the process we are liv¬ 
ing through today is sufficiently differ¬ 
ent in degree that it has become differ¬ 
ent in kind. It is divestiture without 
reinvestment. 

We are living in "a stillness between 
tides, neither going out nor coming in," 
in E. L. Doctorow's phrase, and as we 
wait to see what the tide will bring in, 
the rule of irony compels us to ask cer¬ 
tain urgent questions. Can irony yield 
any sense of evil? Is the ironist capable 
of making discriminations of value? Or 
is he condemned to live in a contingent 
world of morally indistinguishable 
actions and events, in which all ideas 
are denigrated as ideologies? If, for 
example, we read today the words of 
John Foster Dulles in 1948, when he 
decried the expansion into Europe of 
Soviet Communism "by methods of 
penetration, propaganda, and terror¬ 
ism ... the like of which men have not 
seen since, one thousand years ago, the 
new and dynamic Moslem faith struck 
out against the established institutions 
of Christendom," we are quick, and 


right, to ask the ironist's questions. By 
what arrogance did Dulles dare exempt 
from his moral indignation the Inquisi¬ 
tion or other crimes committed in the 
name of "Christendom"? And what 
about the brutal "Christian" conquest of 
the New World, or indeed the whole 
history of European class warfare, 
racism, and imperialism? Dulles's anal¬ 
ogy between the Russians and the Mus¬ 
lim hordes sounds the unmistakable 
note of what we would now call "Ori¬ 
entalism"; and so we consign him to the 
dismissible category of Cold Warrior. 

But after these points have been 
made, does the ironist ask whether 
Dulles was right about Stalin? Is it pos¬ 
sible for such a question to arise in the 
ironist's mind? In the face of some new 
Stalin or Hitler, is it possible to shake off 
the lethargy induced by irony and rise 
to the fight? 

History does not encourage an affir¬ 
mative answer to these questions. This 
is so because, as the philosopher Paul 
Ricoeur has said, "there is no taboo in 
which there does not dwell some rever¬ 
ence, some veneration of order." With¬ 
out reverence for something, there can be 
no proscriptions—and it should be clear 
enough to any observer of contempo¬ 
rary culture that we are short on both. 
Irony has proven to be a more potent 
solvent of our erstwhile beliefs than any 
contending belief. Yet for all its power 
to dissolve the presumptions of the 
past, it cannot produce future commit¬ 
ments. Its energy is negative. When it 
does the work of exposure, it can open 
up the view like any demolition work. 
But afterward, it is of no use in the 
work of rebuilding. 

Take, for instance, the case of femi¬ 


nism, perhaps the most important social 
force of the last twenty-five years, and 
one that claims to have revealed a form 
of evil that had hitherto remained hid¬ 
den behind the unexamined axioms of 
gender hierarchy. Writing in the early 
days of the women's movement, the 
critic Mary Ellmann addressed what she 
called (before the term had become a 
cliche) "phallic criticism." She had just 
read a review by a male critic of a new 
novel by Franqoise Sagan, the French 
writer who, as a teenager, had made a 
sensation with her coming-of-age tale 
Bonjour Tristesse (1954). The reviewer 
did not like Sagan's new book, and said 
so in these terms: 

Poor old Frangoise Sagan. Just one 
more old-fashioned old-timer, 
bypassed in the rush for the latest lit¬ 
erary vogue and for youth. Superficial¬ 
ly, her career in America resembles the 
lifespan of those medieval beauties 
who flowered at 14, were deflowered 
at 15, were old at 30, and crones at 40. 

Ellmann's response was to offer "a 
review of a new novel by the popular 
French novelist Franqois Sagan," cast in 
the same terms: 

Poor old Francois Sagan.... Superfi¬ 
cially, his career in America resembles 
the lifespan of those medieval trouba¬ 
dours who masturbated at 14, copu¬ 
lated at 15, were impotent at 30, and 
prostate cases at 40. 

Finding herself for no discernible rea¬ 
son in a culture where "the literal fact of 
masculinity, unlike femininity, does not 
impose an erogenic form upon all 
aspects of the person's career," Ellmann 
availed herself of the vocabulary that 
was customarily used to force women's

"We shudder or wince; then we switch the channel." 


Andrew Delbanco's The Death of Satan is really an old- 
fashioned book. 

Its subjects—good and evil, personal responsibility, the 
nation's moral imagination—are not the sort of themes frontally 
addressed by many scholars nowadays. Profes¬ 
sor Delbanco's willingness to violate discipli¬ 
nary boundaries—he ranges confidently 
through literature, history and religion, pausing 
to consider thinkers from Augustine to Lincoln 
to Martin Luther King and Reinhold 
Niebuhr—is also uncommon in the hyperspe- 
cialized world of today's academy. And, perhaps 
most anachronistically, his writing is almost 
completely free of impenetrable academic jargon: 
in the tradition of such Columbia predecessors 
as Lionel Trilling '25, Allan Nevins, and 
Richard Hofstadter, Mr. Delbanco has created a rich work of eru¬ 
dition and originality in a language that is clear and eloquent, 
even visceral. "The result," writes Wendy Doniger in The New 
York Times Book Review, "is a stunning and moving ethical 
interpretation of the concept of evil in American private and 
public life from the first settlers to the present." 

Mr. Delbanco himself calls the work "a kind of national 


spiritual biography," written, he says, because "a gulf has 
opened up in our culture between the visibility of evil and the 
intellectual resources available for coping with it." At one time, 
most Americans believed in God and Satan. By and large, we no 
longer give the devil his due, but the modern 
culture of irony hasn't come up with the proper 
language to respond to the world's horrors and 
outrages. "We shudder or wince; then we 
switch the channel," he writes. 

An authority on American literature, Mr. 
Delbanco joined Columbia's department of Eng¬ 
lish and comparative literature in 1985 after 
several years on the faculty of Harvard Univer¬ 
sity, where he earned a B.A. in 1973, an M.A. 
in 1976, and a Ph.D. in 1980. He is now Julian 
Clarence Levi Professor in the Humanities. The 
author of The Puritan Ordeal (which received Columbia's 1990 
Lionel Trilling Award) and other works, he contributes frequent¬ 
ly to such periodicals as The New Republic and The New 
Yorker, and lectures extensively throughout the United States 
and abroad. Mr. Delbanco, a native New Yorker, lives in Morn- 
ingside Heights with his wife. Dawn, and two children. 

J.C.K. 



lives into a preposterous "erogenic 
form." She knew that it sounded nor¬ 
mative when applied to women, and 
outrageous when applied to men. This 
is a fine particular instance of the iro¬ 
nist's general point—that if one shifts 
the context of any received idea, it will 
be revealed as a convention. The iro¬ 
nist's tactic is a version of the child's 
maddening game of asking "why" after 
every assertion or command. Even as 
the parents grow exasperated, they 
know that the child has a point—that 
there is no good answer to the "why" 
and that the game will end with a 
decree and a fiat: "Because 1 said so." 

This discovery of what the deconstruc¬ 
tionists call absence at the core of authori¬ 
ty ("by vast pains we mine into the pyra¬ 
mid," as Melville put it long ago, "by 
horrible gropings we come to the central 
room; with joy we espy the sarcophagus; 
but we lift the lid—and no body is 
there!—") gives impetus to the reformer 
who would deny the metaphysical 
claims of those who hold power. In the 
ironist's eye every pretender to legitimate 
authority becomes a Wizard of Oz, and 
the point is to draw aside the curtain. 


But when the exposure has been per¬ 
formed and the next point is reached— 
the point at which the world that was 
dismantled must be rebuilt—irony is of 
no use. If one reveals the foundations of 
the culture as floating on nothing, if one 
exposes its empirical approach to expe¬ 
rience, its instrumentalist view of 
nature, its "possessive individualism"— 
the whole catalogue of inheritances 
from the Enlightenment—as historically 
evolved rather than naturally sanc¬ 
tioned, how, then, do we respond when 
the absence of these principles in other 
cultures seems to have something to do 
with the horrors they perpetrate? How 
does the radical feminist react, say, to 
the fact that female genital mutilation is 
a regular cultural practice in some non- 
Western societies? Adept as she is at 
exposing the contingent nature of all 
cultures and the arrogance of imputing 
superiority to one's own, how is she to 
justify her outrage? When she shudders 
at the idea that some adolescent girls 
have their labia sewn together or their 
clitoris amputated, is she not reacting 
from within a specific cultural context 
in which her own sensibility was 


formed? What basis does irony give her 
to intervene or even object? 

The truth is, if she is to invoke the 
ideology of individual rights—the 
rights, in this case, to own one's own 
body and to experience sexual plea¬ 
sure—she is reverting to a cultural 
vocabulary which has claimed univer- 
salism but which she has exposed as 
contingent. The historian David 
Hollinger has recently brought atten¬ 
tion to this issue in what he calls "the 
case of the Masai women." He reviews 
it with some irony of his own: 

If these women are but breeding stock 
and, when barren of sons, are treated 
by their warrior masters as inferior to 
cattle, who are we to criticize? It is 
part of Masai culture, after all. And 
we probably should not even talk 
about it, as such talk might flatter 
Western prejudice and might lead us 
to forget how much violence and 
injustice are suffered by women in the 
— llnited States and Western Europe. 

He continues in this ironic vein; the 
only way that we could rescue the

AN INTERVIEW 


Columbia College Today 


Although JFK Jr. 

insists his new magazine 

was named for George Stephanopoulos, 


it is nonetheless true that the media-savvy former Rhodes 
Scholar, campaign whiz kid, and Presidential spokesman 
remains one of the most powerful people of his generation. 
He has survived crises large and small during the first three 
years of the Clinton administration and has retained a key 
role in the innermost circle of the President's staff as senior 
advisor for policy and strategy. 

"If George's I.Q. could be converted to Fahrenheit, that boy 
could boil water," James Carville has said. And indeed, Mr. 
Stephanopoulos was one of the most brilliant students of his 
generation at Columbia College, where he graduated summa 
cum laude in 1982 as class salutatorian. From his undergraduate 
experience, he singles out the core curriculum and four of his 
teachers for special praise: political scientists Charles V. Hamil¬ 
ton, Marshall Shulman and Richard 
Pious, and wrestling coach Ron 
Russo. "I wrote my first memo to 
the President as an assignment for 
Richard Pious's course. It was on 
Saudi arms sales," Mr. 

Stephanopoulos says. Does he 
remember his grade on the assign¬ 
ment? "I think I got an A." 

After College and two years at 
Oxford studying theology and 
ethics—his father is a leading 
Greek Orthodox clergyman—Mr. 

Stephanopoulos quickly amassed 
a glittering political resume as a 
Congressional staffer and top- 
level Presidential campaign opera¬ 
tive, first in the '88 Dukakis effort, 
then in '92 with Bill Clinton. 

"Stephanopoulos is the ultimate 
political meritocrat," wrote veter-

to start something," says the senior

an White House correspondent Matthew Cooper '84 in a pro¬ 
file shortly before the Clinton team came to power. 

CCT spoke to Mr. Stephanopoulos on a broiling late June 
afternoon in his small office in the West Wing, steps from the 
Oval Office. The air is tense with issues and activity—the 
budget battle, a major statement on affirmative action, a tiff 
over last night's White House reception—and the brutal pace 
and stress of his work have clearly taken a toll on the 
famously boyish Stephanopoulos features. Yet he is calm, 
focused, and gracious of time and spirit. Some excerpts: 

CCT: Your career has been devoted to an ideal of government ser¬ 
vice. And yet many Americans now seem to be rejecting govern¬ 
ment. It seems that authority is draining away from Washington. 

Stephanopoulos: There's no 
question about it, but there's a 
paradox beneath that. People are 
against government except when 
it reaches out to help them, 
whether it's responding to the dis¬ 
aster in Oklahoma City, or the 
floods in the Midwest, or the 
earthquake in California, or help¬ 
ing seniors with health care in the 
Medicare system, or student loans 
for higher education—then they 
say, 'Hey! Don't touch that!' Deal¬ 
ing with that paradox has been 
difficult for us, because one of the 
things the President is committed 
to is actually trying to increase the 
investments in education, in 
health care, in training that will 
give people the security to do well 
in the economy. But if you're 
going to balance the budget and 
bring down the deficit, you have 
to cut into the very programs that 
provide the most benefits to peo¬ 
ple. I think we've come up with a 
budget that does the least amount

of harm possible. But it's still going to require some pain. 
And the only way you can then get something like that done 
is if you spread the burden equitably throughout the society. 
It's difficult to do that, because often here in Washington, 
those who have the most power and the most money have 
the most sway over the budget. So in a time o'f fiscal disci¬ 
pline, you often end up in the horrible situation where those 
who need help the most are the first to lose it. 

Are you troubled, on a philosophical level, that so many Americans 
are openly hostile to the Federal government—not just in the mili¬ 
tia movement, for example, but in Congress itself? 

Well, it's a long way from the government being of the peo¬ 
ple, by the people and for the people, to the government as 
the enemy of normal people, as Speaker Gingrich would say. 
That has in part been deliberately created by politicians, par¬ 
ticularly Republicans who have run against all kinds of gov¬ 
ernment for an awful long time. 

But there are legitimate complaints about overregulation. One 
of things I've come to see more clearly is the problem of literal¬ 
ism. By the time a pohcy directive gets filtered down to the local 
level, it's tied up in so many rigid regulations that it loses all 
common sense. Phihp Howard has written about that in his 
book. The Death of Common Sense. Ideas that are valid in theory 
become very intrusive in practice. One of the things we've been 
doing through the Vice President's Reinventing Government 
initiative is trying to find ways to cut away that red tape. 

At the same time, I think there's another political dynamic 
going on, and that is an overall loss of faith in leaders gener¬ 
ally. If you have the negative synergy of Watergate on top of 
Vietnam, followed by a decade when political leaders 
promised fiscal discipline and delivered huge deficits, there's 
no question you're going to see more and more cynicism. But 
that has spread out also to the media, even to entertainment. 

I mean, the whole message of things like David Letterman is, 
'Don't take anything too seriously' That's healthy to a point, 
but the cumulative effect of that sort of skepticism, layered 
throughout the society, can't help but be cynicism. 

On the other hand. I'm encouraged by the number of peo¬ 
ple 18 to 25 who really are re-engaging with public service, 
not even politics necessarily, but community work. But that's 
combined with an overall insecurity about the long-term 
direction of the country and their own job prospects. One 
may have something to do with the other. People begin to 
ask, 'What's important in my life? Where can I make the 
most difference?' And often it is at a more local level. 

As a student of history, do you take a special interest in presiden¬ 
tial advisors? For example, you've been compared to Robert 
Kennedy in terms of youth and political intensity. 

[Laughs] History for me now is what was in yesterday's 
newspaper, not what's in a real history book. 


One of the first political biographies I read was Jack 
Newfield's biography of Bobby Kermedy. I remember being 
inspired not only by Bobby and his passion and political fear¬ 
lessness, but by his transformation over time, from counselor 
to Joe McCarthy to vehement anti-war activist. I was also 
struck by the stories of Peter Edelman and Jeff Greenfield, who 
were his young aides at the time. I often remember thinking of 
them as role models. Beyond that, I think one person who I 
actually know and admire a lot, and is someone who did his 
job so superbly, is Bill Moyers, who was press secretary for 
Lyndon Johnson. He always kept a strong balance between his 
loyalty to Johnson and what he felt was right for the country. 
He has also managed not to let that be the defining experience 
of his life, which I think is a great danger for people who get 
these jobs. Not that you should constantly be striving for some¬ 
thing higher or better or anything like that, but that you should 
not allow this experience which is absolutely unique and an 
incredible privilege, and also unbelievably stressful, to be the 
end of your service or your intellectual curiosity or engage¬ 
ment. You know that it can't last forever, and because of that, at 
least I've tried to just squeeze every moment out of it. But I 
hope that when it's over, I can take what I've learned here and 
find other ways to be productive and engaged. 

Your father was quoted in an article in 1992 as saying that you 
understood the myth of Icarus. Is that a remark that resonates for 
you now, three years later? 

Oh sure, it's something you always keep in the front of your 
head. And you know that, especially in a high-profile politi¬ 
cal life, there are going to be a lot of ups and downs. It's the 
kind of myth that you always know intellectually, but under¬ 
stand only after you've seen it up close. Understanding it 
helps one both do a better job and keep both the ups and the 
downs in perspective. The cycles of political life, like all 
other life now in the United States, are so fast that you have 
got to insulate yourself. One way that I deal with it some¬ 
times is by pretending that—no matter whatever is being 
said about you publicly, good or bad—it's happening to a fic¬ 
tional character. You've just got to keep on doing the job that 
you came here to do in the first place. 

Was your experience as a Rhodes Scholar at Balliol wonderful, or 
was it disappointing? 

Oh, it was both. I first applied for the Rhodes when I was at 
Columbia and got nowhere. But I came to Washington and 
worked and, luckily enough, the second time around, made 
it through the process. 

It was difficult at times. England isn't necessarily the most 
hospitable place in the world, although I've come to appreci¬ 
ate it more over time. But it was really an intellectual feast. I

Columbia's Rhodes Scholars: 

Bang the mash slowly 


BY Shira J. Boss '93 


O ne thing George Stephanopoulos '82 has in 
common with his boss in the Oval Office is 
that both are members of an elite cadre that 
has been called a "secret society of men 
groomed to go out and take over the world"— 
or, at the other extreme, mere wiimers of "a highly subjective 
academic beauty contest." 

Either way, they are heirs to one of the most prestigious tra¬ 
ditions in academia—^the Rhodes Scholarship. In the popular 
imagination, its recipients are the cream, the anointed, like 
Nobel Prize winners, wearing their distinction like a golden 
feather in their well-rounded caps. Nmety-two years ago, when 
Cedi Rhodes bequeathed the scholarships that bear his name, 
his purpose was nothing less than the upbringing of future 
leaders and public servants in a uniquely British environment 
of cultural and sodal values and the classic tutorial system—^to 
prepare "the best men for the world's fight," as he put it. 

The 32 Americans now chosen annually for the two- or 
three- year program of study at Oxford may no longer be 
empire builders—or even men—^but the scholarship still car¬ 
ries a unique cachet. For past Rhodes Scholars, the Oxford 
legacy can constitute intellectual enhghtenment, pohtical com¬ 
mitment, life-affirming love affairs with the 700-year-old uni¬ 
versity, or just plain wondering over what all the fuss is about. 
As one famous remark ruefully put it—^referring to the exhih- 
ration and charmed Oxford days that follow selection—"A 
Rhodes Scholar is a man with a brilhant future behind him." 


"It was late afternoon, and the sun was slanting across 
the front quadrangle of New College, the finest example of 
English Gothic architecture in the world," recalls Jeff Rud- 
man '70, a senior law partner at Hale and Dorr in Boston, 
of his arrival at Oxford. "From the moment I put my foot in 
the portal, I was swept away, and stayed swept away for 
two years. I never got over the feeling that I was living in 
the most beautiful place in the world." 

The gothic turrets, sprawUng green lawns, and cobblestone 
streets, Mr. Rudman says, gave him "pure bliss"—the prover¬ 
bial best years of his life. "Just going to the library was an 
inexpressible inspiration," agrees Erich Gruen '57, professor 
of history at U.C.-Berkeley. 

In some cases, the Rhodes gives crucial perspective to 
one's life, shaking up value systems and career paths. 
Assistant Professor of Political Science Carlton Long '84 
says he left Columbia as a die-hard black nationalist, con¬ 
vinced he had all the answers to issues of race and equality. 
But his study of affirmative action while at Oxford sent him 
back to the intellectual drawing board as he started to 
"integrate a broader view, one of global humanism." 

"The scholarship is a tremendous honor," says Robert 
Radtke '87, senior program associate with the Asia Society 
"but with it comes a feeling of responsibility to contribute 
to society. It puts a real burden of expectation on scholars. 
The ultimate goal is to end up giving more to society than 
you took away." In the words of Lyle Rexer '73, "Rhodes 
Scholars are not intellectuals. Their first com¬ 
mitment is not to the mind, it's to the world." 

Carl Marci '91 embarked upon his Rhodes 
after serving as captain of the track team, 
graduating cum laude with a 3.78 CPA, and 
being cited by Time magazine for academic 
achievement and community service, which 
included providing meals to AIDS patients. Yet 
he recalls constantly wondering, "Am I doing 
enough?" As a third-year student at Harvard 
Medical School he is still answering that ques¬ 
tion; he founded and chairs the Student Initia¬ 
tive for Financial Aid Reform and volunteers 
for the YMCA Americorps. 

"The committee might seek people who will 
be actively involved in the community, but 
many are ordinary people leading ordinary 
lives," observed the late Stephen Vargish '62, 
who was active on both state and regional 
Rhodes selection committees. "The main thing 
is to humanize it—to get rid of the 'Oh my 



Nineteenth-century academic procession at St. Mary's College

God, it's a Rhodes Scholar' reaction." Among the College's 
Rhodes alumni who are quietly leading distinguished lives 
are Richard Merrill '59, former dean of the University of 
Virginia Law School, and Mr. Vargish's brother, Thomas '60, 
a professor of English at the University of Maryland and 
the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. 

The essence of the Rhodes experience is enrolling at 
Oxford, a transition that catches some Scholars off guard, 
and not just because of the bangers and mash, spotted dick, 
and other dubious culinary offerings. 

"My problem with the British was that they were so British," 
says Professor Long. "I hated England and Oxford at first: the 
xenophobic culture, some of the attitudes, the coldness and 
awkwardness of the imdergraduates, completely inexplicable 
references to the Queen, and a lack of sophistication when it 
came to a racial discourse and issues of sexual equality were 
very disconcerting." 

Mr. Rexer, too, felt alienated, saying that sometimes it took 
him years to realize he'd been insulted. Unlike Mr. Long and 
others who went through rough periods of adjustment but 
ultimately acclimated, Mr. Rexer never quite came to grips 
with what he calls "incredible cultural insularity." He took a 
leave of absence from Merton College following his first year 
and never returned. Now a New York-based writer, Mr. 

Rexer has written a short story in which all of the people 
surrounding him at Oxford turn into vampires. 

His feelings are perhaps not unique. At one informal 
Rhodes reunion, he met a Scholar who told him, "I put my 
Greek books away in the closet and never take them out, 
because every time I do I cry." Mr. Rexer says that for 
many, Oxford is about the Greek books and being back 
home is about the crying. 

11 told, few College alumni have been Rhodes 
Scholars. By contrast, some of the other Ivies 
are virtual Rhodes mills, with panels that 
actively recruit students, oversee their applica¬ 
tions, and extensively coach them for inter¬ 
views. With only three recipients in the first half-century of 
the scholarship and 16 since, Columbia isn't even in the same 
league with Harvard (274), Yale (189), or Princeton (177). 

When Mr. Rexer appeared on NBC's Today show with a 
Rhodie from Yale, the difference was brought home dramat¬ 
ically: "I showed up dressed basically like a farmer, in dun- 
garees, and with pretty long hair—which I'd specifically 
gotten cut for the show—and the guy from Yale came in 
looking like a perfect lawyer: three-piece suit, wire-rimmed 
f} glasses, the whole bit." 

Explanations for why the College and the Rhodes have not 
been a good "fit" vary. Richard Menaker '69, a former Rhodes 
Scholar who is now with the New York law firm of Menaker 
& Herrmann, thinks reverse snobbery may be to blame, sug¬ 
gesting the College administration "didn't look very highly 
or enthusiastically upon the scholarship because it was 
viewed as a non-academic honor." When Mr. Rexer requested 
an application at the Dean's office, he was told, "You know, 

(continued on page 53) 

was viewed as a non-academic honor. 


And what I valued most was the chance to study something 
that was 'impractical,' that I never would've been able to do 
had I not had the scholarship. I also had the chance to really 
travel an awful lot while I was there. I went to Africa twice, 
and South America, and all through Europe. You can't buy 
that kind of experience. So there's an awful lot I'll always 
cherish about it, not the least of which is a lot of the good 
friends I made there who really are strong, strong friends. You 
have a lot of time to talk and think and reflect in Oxford, and 
so the bonds that you forge there really last. 

Does it give you one more link with that other Rhodes Scholar, Bill 
Clinton? 

A little bit, but not really. No. 

Where do you go home at night, where do you eat, when do you 
socialize, when do you exercise—how do you live your life? 

[Laughs] I live right down the street in Dupont Circle, not a 
mile away, so it's very easy to get here in the morning. One of 
the reasons I chose to live there was it's right in the middle of 
the city. And that enables me at least to have some semblance, 
not of a normal life, but of contact with people that I wouldn't 
otherwise get. Otherwise, if I just sort of lived out in a suburb, 
I would just go from my bubble of an apartment to the bubble 
of the office, and not get a lot of contact. I'm here from about 
6:15 in the morning until at least 8 every night. There's not a 
lot of time for pure relaxation, but all of us try, whenever the 
President goes on vacation, to at least grab a few days of vaca¬ 
tion, because you need to get away. 

How would you say you've grown since coming here? 

One thing you learn is that it's much easier to stop something 
than to start something. You have to factor that in. That proba¬ 
bly requires a certain scaling back, not of ambition, but of 
claims for what you're trying to get done. Learning how to 
bring the public along with an agenda is something that we've 
all had to learn to do a better job of. 

What would be the example? 

The budget is one example: I think one of the things the Presi¬ 
dent has internalized is that it's not enough just to ram things 
through the Congress. You have to learn how to tell people 
about them and tell them what you've gotten done, and let it 
sink in. We've also tried to space out our projects more now. 
But you know, in the White House you can only control so 
much. The world happens. Bombings happen, wars continue 
to rage in other parts of the world. One of the other things you 
learn is to understand what you can't control, even from the 
White House, and learn better how to roll with it. 

How would you rate President Clinton's chances in '96? 

Oh, he's going to win. The President's approval ratings now are 
equivalent to what Ronald Reagan's were at this point in his 
first term. That's certainly higher than Jimmy Carter's at this 
point in his first term. I think once people actually have a real 
race to focus on, and a real choice, they're going to look at the 
President's record and see that he has made a start at achieving 
what he set out to achieve, that the economy is strong, that we 
are substantially at peace throughout the world, and that the 
President, tempered by the experience of a first term but still 
having the energy of a very young and very intelligent man, is 
the best choice to take the country into the next century.

than Columbia. This allowed me 
to believe that Columbia had not

s any sophomore will 
tell you, matter can 
neither be created nor 
destroyed—only changed into 
another form of energy. 

The same can also be said of 
"Getting To Know You," by 
Richard Rodgers '23 and Oscar 
Hammerstein 11 '16. For it turns 
out that this schottische, sung by 
Gertrude Lawrence as Anna in 
The King and I in 1951, was origi¬ 
nally meant to be sung by Lt. Joe 
Cable (William Tabbert) in the 
previous R&H collaboration. 
South Pacific, two years earlier. 

The story was revealed on 
July 12 during Something Won¬ 
derful, a 100th birthday tribute 
to Mr. Hammerstein at New 
York's Gershwin Theatre, home 
to the acclaimed revival of the 
classic Hammerstein-Jerome 
Kern collaboration Show Boat. 
Theodore Chapin, president of 
the Rodgers & Hammerstein 
Organization, told of how 
archivists at the Library of Con¬ 
gress had recently found a curi¬ 


ous manuscript among Mr. 
Hammerstein's papers. The 
lyrics were as unfamiliar as the 
title—"Suddenly Lovely." But 
the music, by Mr. Rodgers, was 
a perfect match for "Getting To 
Know You." 

The pages didn't indicate any 
provenance. However, the cele¬ 
brated producer Joshua Logan 
had written in his memoirs that 
during rehearsals for South Pacif¬ 
ic he had cut a song that Lt. 
Cable was to warble to Liat, his 
inamorata. "1 love the tune," Mr. 
Logan told R&H, "but isn't that 
song a bit lightweight for a hot, 
lusty boy to sing right after mak¬ 
ing love to a girl who will 
change his life?" The tune, he 
wrote (and which he errantly 
remembered as "Suddenly 
Lucky"), was reincarnated as 
"Getting To Know You." 

"Suddenly Lovely" made its 
Broadway debut during Some¬ 
thing Wonderful when Doug 
LaBrecque, one of the stars of 
Show Boat, did the honor of 


breathing life into the song— 
whose lyrics follow: 

"Suddenly Lovely" 

Suddenly lovely, 

Suddenly my life is lovely. 
Suddenly living 
Certainly looks good to me. 
Suddenly happy 
Suddenly my heart is happy. 

Is it a girl? 

Could be, could be! 

Suddenly lovely. 

Suddenly to be together. 

Suddenly sharing 
Ev'rything we hear and see. 

Suddenly won'ring. 

Suddenly I wonder whether 
Are we in love forever and for 
good? 

Are we happy as we could be? 
Could be!

Mourning Becomes the Type¬ 
writer: We mourn the decision of 
Smith-Corona to cease manufac¬ 
turing typewriters. Evidently no 
company in this coimtry still 
makes the once-ubiquitous 
machine. A typewriter has been 
our daily companion since 1920. 
(We are writing this obituary on an 
IBM Selectric II.) I know that the 
essentials of my life's direction 
have depended on the typewriter, 
and hereby twists this tale. 

In early June of 1925,1 drove 
east with a University of Col¬ 
orado professor and his family. 
We dropped his wife and chil¬ 
dren off at Portsmouth, Ohio, 
after which Professor Birk and I 
drove on to Schenectady, where 
he was attending a convention of 
professors of English. I took the 
Interurban to Albany and the 
Hudson River night boat to New 
York City. Awakened at dawn as 
we were sailing by the red cliffs 
of New Jersey's Palisades, I was 
startled and not at all sure that I 
was really in New York. 

With a letter of introduction 
from a friend in Boulder to his 
uncle, the Master of the Port of 
New York, I obtained a job as a 
waiter on the S.S. Ulua, one of the 
United Fruit Company's "banana 
boats" (English registry). A few 
days later, we departed from 
New York harbor. Never having 
been on the ocean before, I won¬ 
dered about seasickness. But by 
the time I had served two tables I 
realized that the land was out of 


sight; so I never did get seasick, 
despite a huge hurricane that 
plagued our fourth trip in Sep¬ 
tember. 

Our ports of call were Havana, 
Cuba; Cristobal in the Canal 
Zone; and Limon, Costa Rica. At 
the last port we anchored for sev¬ 
eral days to take on a shipment of 
bananas. (Once a frozen stow¬ 
away was discovered behind a 
stack of the fruit in the refrigerat¬ 
ed hold.) My job as a waiter was 
not onerous. There was even time 
to get to know a Cuban family on 
the way to Havana, as well as the 
United Fruit Company represen¬ 
tative who lived in Limon. 

On the first trip back from 
Cristobal, I happened to pass the 
cabin of our ship's chief steward. 
He was heavyset, of medium 
height, and a stern master. So 
when I noticed that he was 
swearing at a typewriter, I timid¬ 
ly stepped one foot into the cabin 
and asked if he needed any help. 
When he learned I could type, he 
practically threw the machine at 
me. On the spot, I was moved 
from the "Glory Hole" (the wait¬ 
ers' quarters under a hatch in the 
prow of the ship where we slept 
in hammocks) to a cabin amid- 
ship with a real bunk, and I was 
promoted from dining room 
steward to officer third steward. 
By the time we steamed out of 
Havana, I was wearing a white 
uniform with one blue stripe at 
the end of the sleeve and also on 
the epaulets of my jacket.

FDR's pipeline to Walter Winchell 



Ernest Cuneo '27, emerging from the White House in 
1944: Washington insider and Broadway bon vivant 

PHOTO: AP/WIDE WORLD 


Editor's Note: Many Americans 
remember the legendary Broadway 
gossip columnist Walter Winchell 
as a frenzied, Red-baiting mouth¬ 
piece for Sen. Joseph McCarthy 
and his chief counsel, Roy Cohn 
'46. When the New York Post ran 
a critical series on Mr. Winchell in 
1952, he declared war on its liberal 
editor, James Wechsler '35, dub¬ 
bing his paper the “N.Y. Poo," the 
"Compost," and the "Postitute." 

Less well remembered is the 
crusading Winchell of the 1930's 
and 40's who alerted the country 
to the evils of Nazism and cheered 
on the New Deal. Mr. Winchell's 
pipeline to the White House was 
Ernest Cuneo '27, a leading figure 
in Democratic circles who later 
owned the North American News¬ 
paper Alliance. Mr. Cuneo, who 
died in 1988, was also a liaison 
officer to the F.B.I. and British 
Intelligence for the O.S.S.; Ian 
Fleming would dedicate his James 
Bond novel Thunderball to him. 

In his biography Winchell 
(Knopf, 1994), Neal Gabler recalls 
the symbiosis between columnist 
and politico, with "Walter gaining 
entree to the world of politics and 
diplomacy, Cuneo gaining entree 
to the world of show business and 
society." 

T hough readers and 
listeners assumed 
Winchell was privy 
to inside informa¬ 
tion, there was 

something most of them didn't 
know that lent weight to his 
predictions and positions on 
the conflict, something that 
prompted even the Germans to 
monitor his broadcasts. What 
his audience didn't know was 
that in shaping American atti¬ 
tudes toward the war, Winchell 
was often speaking for the Roo¬ 
sevelt administration just as he 
had in areas of domestic policy. 

The source of this authority 
was Ernest Cuneo, the affable, 
erudite associate counsel of the 
Democratic National Commit¬ 
tee. Weighing nearly 300 
pounds—Walter affectionately 
called him Fatso—-with small, 
dancing eyes and a huge swath 
of a smile, Cuneo was a man of 
Falstaffian proportions both 
physically and temperamental¬ 
ly. A friend described him as a 
Renaissance man who was 
equally comfortable with Greek, 


Latin, the histo¬ 
ry of science, 
world history 
and English lit¬ 
erature. A florid 
speaker with a 
booming voice 
given to oro- 
timd expression, 
he could and 
did quote 
Shakespeare at 
the drop of a 
hat. But he was 
hardly a dry 
pedant. "Ernie 
looked like what 
he was," said 
another friend. 

His girth testi¬ 
fied to his love 
of the good life, 
and his spirit 
was large, gen¬ 
erous, and infec¬ 
tious. " 'Cham¬ 
pagne for every¬ 
body in the 
house,'" 
remembered 
[Winchell assis¬ 
tant] Herman 
Klurfeld. "That 
was Ernie." 

The son of an Italian immi¬ 
grant who owned a scrap 
metal plant, he was born in 
1905 in Carlstadt, N.J. A 
scholastic football phenom, 
Cuneo enrolled at Penn State 
University but was bounced 
from the freshman football 
team for reasons he never dis¬ 
closed. (His son [Jonathan '74] 
believed that a prank probably 
had misfired.) Having trans¬ 
ferred to Columbia, Cuneo 
starred as left guard on its 
football team while working 
his way through school writ¬ 
ing for the Daily News. 

More important, at Columbia 
he fell under the influence of 
three brilliant liberal profes¬ 
sors—Adolf A. Berle, Jr., Drew 
Pearson, and William O. Dou¬ 
glas—who instilled in him a 
sense of justice and a spirit of 
liberalism he was never to lose. 
He attended Columbia Law 
School, was thrown out, again 
for reasons he never disclosed, 
and was eventually graduated 
from St. John's Law School. 
Fresh out of school, he landed a 
job with New York's new pro¬ 
gressive mayor, Fiorello La 


Guardia, while on the week¬ 
ends he played professional 
football for the Stapleton Cardi¬ 
nals on Staten Island. 

No one seemed to know 
exactly what he did for La 
Guardia, but Cuneo was a born 
fixer. When Roosevelt entered 
the White House, taking with 
him Cuneo's mentors Berle and 
Douglas, Cuneo joined the 
administration and served as a 
troubleshooter for Tommy 
Corcoran, a young Harvard- 
educated attorney by way of 
the Irish ghetto and a political 
Machiavellian. It was Corcoran 
who assigned Cuneo the task 
of assisting Michigan Governor 
Frank Murphy and pro-Roo¬ 
sevelt labor leaders in keeping 
the lid on labor tensions after 
the auto strikes in 1937. When 
Murphy became attorney gen¬ 
eral, Cuneo became his self- 
described "legman" in the fight 
for civil rights from the Ken¬ 
tucky coalfields to the political 
back rooms of Louisiana, 

Kansas City and Jersey City. It 
was then, he said, that he began 
tunneling information to 
Winchell, though in actuality 


by the time Murphy was 
appointed attorney general in 
January 1939, Cuneo was 
already an intimate of Walter's. 

They had met early in 1938, 
when the President, a pre¬ 
sumed lame duck, was locked 
in combat with conservatives 
of his own party. The Presi¬ 
dent's liberal supporters were 
pressing him to name an heir 
who might serve as a rallying 
point. "There was only one 
person who could give instant 
recognition to a dark horse 
candidate," Cuneo advised 
Corcoran. "Walter Winchell." 

Cuneo arranged to meet Wal¬ 
ter. Fearing they would be too 
conspicuous on the columnist's 
turf at the Stork Club, Cuneo 
phoned Leonard Lyons, a 
friend, and asked if he would 
invite Walter to '21.' "I opened 
with an amenity," Cuneo 
remembered, telling Walter that 
he had seen George Jessel the 
other night and that Jessel had 
reminisced about his days in 
vaudeville when he and Walter 
were children. "The hell with 
that," Walter snapped. "That 
son of a bitch started to remi¬ 
nisce when he was eight years 
old." What Walter wanted to 
know is "What's going to hap¬ 
pen tomorrow?" 

Cuneo was shrewd enough 
to realize that if he were to 
ingratiate himself with Walter, 
he would have to deliver for 
"The Column." Scanning the 
room, he spotted Lord Lothian, 
the British ambassador to the 
United States, and introduced 
Walter in the hope that Lothian 
might provide some news 
about British policy. "Lord 
Lothian, what is Great Britain 
going to do about Hitler?" Wal¬ 
ter asked immediately. "Mr. 
Winchell, we shall try to fatten 
the tiger without strengthening 
him," answered Lothian, one of 
the champions of appeasement. 
"I've seen some big tigers and 
some little tigers," Walter said. 
"I've never seen a fat one." The 
next day Walter reported that 
"Britain will marry Hitler in the 
fall. The marriage will blow up 
into a World War."

Last June my wife and I met 
President and Mrs. Rupp at a 
reception at the Garden City 
Hotel on Long Island. Alumni 
from every Columbia school 
were represented, about 500 
in all. 

Recently, to celebrate our 55th 
wedding anniversary, we cruised 
the Inside Passage in Alaska on 
the M.S. Statendam. I highly rec¬ 
ommend the trip. 

I regret to report the death of 
Harry Richards. Harry was our 
class president some years ago. 
We will certainly miss him and 
we extend our sympathy to his 
family.

Over the next few issues, we will 
highlight news we received in an 
enthusiastic response to the 60th 
Reunion questionnaires. 

Oliver Neshamkin of New 
York City closed his private prac¬ 
tice in 1989 and now works 20 
hours a week in the medical 


department of the International 
Ladies Garment Workers Union. 

Alfred E Fretz, emeritus mem¬ 
ber of St. Luke's department of 
urology, keeps an eye on Colum¬ 
bia from his penthouse which 
overlooks the campus. 

Forest R. Lombaer writes from 
Stuart, Fla.: "My wife and I are 
longtime Life Masters at the 
bridge table. Today we play in 
many of the Florida tournaments, 
but less than we used to in 
national competition." 

Nobel laureate Norman F. 
Ramsey received the Pupin 
Medal in 1992. In 1993 he 
received the Einstein Prize and 
his grandson, Mike, graduated 
from the College. Now, Professor 
Ramsey has been named to 
receive the 1995 Alexander 
Hamilton Medal, the Alumni 
Association's highest honor. [For 
further information on the dinner, 
call Ilene Markay-Hallack at (212) 
870-2769.] 

Leonard Schreiber practices 
law in partnership with his 
daughter, EUen McBride, and is a 
leader in several civic and profes¬ 
sional organizations. He has five 
grandchildren, and reports hav¬ 
ing traveled extensively in 
Europe, the Far East, Africa, and 
Australia, often in connection 
with his practice. 

Jerome S. Schaul is retired but 
teaches two intensive short courses 
in plastics technology at the Center 
for Professional Advancement. He 
continues his longstanding mem¬ 
bership in professional organiza¬ 
tions and is a cellist with the Liv¬ 
ingston, N.J. and Montclair State 
Symphony Orchestras. One of his 
sons, Michael, graduated from the 
College in 1965, and his wife, Ruth, 
is an artist working in pastels. 

Peter C. Rumore of Effingham, 
Ill. "retired" to a 40-hour week in 
general practice and surgical con¬ 
sultation in 1990. He is a diplo- 
mate of the American Board of 
Surgery, serves as president of the 
local Catholic Charities, and is 
active in several professional 
organizations, the Kiwanis Club, 
and the County Board of Health. 

Clark B. Risler has retired 
from Westinghouse, where he 
was an advisory engineer, to a 
continuing care center in Cary, 
N.C., with his wife, Margaret. 

Nicholas A. Renzetti of San 
Marino, Calif, continues at the Jet 
Propulsion Lab at Cal Tech. In 
1992 he received his third NASA 
Medal, this one for exceptional 
engineering achievement. 

Carl M. Relyea of Cincinnati 
writes: "Am semi-retired, working 
part-time as deputy director, 
Hamilton County Emergency 
Management Agency. On Sundays, 
organist at Highland United 
Methodist Church. Granddaughter 


graduated this June from high 
school in Spokane, Wash., as vale¬ 
dictorian. Occasional travel in U.S. 
and Canada." 

John Lattimer received the 
Normandy Invasion Medal in a 
January ceremony at the P&S Fac¬ 
ulty Club. The medal was pre¬ 
sented by the president of the 
French War Veterans. John had 
previously received the Croix de 
Guerre.

summer in Boothbay Harbor, Me. 
Deep into duplicate bridge and in 
computers." 

William M. S. Richards 
walked 13 V 2 miles of the Boston 
Hunger Walk May 7 with over 
$800 total sponsorship. He writes, 
"Hope my flat-arched right foot

Our informal and unofficial 58th 
Reunion in July was pronounced 
a huge success by all classmates 
(and wives) who came to lunch at 
Sardi's famous restaurant. 

Attending classmates included 
George Ames, Charles Baldini, 
Murray Bloom, Manuel Car- 
balleira, Jim Casey, Vince Cieri, 
Anton Doblmaier, Frank Etro, 
Tom Healy, Gene Kalil, John 
Leslie, Vince Meredino, Frank 
Michel, Jack Richter, our host, 
Vince Sardi, your reporter, Wal¬ 
ter Schaap, Ken Steffan and 
Edwin Wilson. 

Sardi served a gourmet lunch 
at a reduced price. Few of us 
were able to resist the first item 
on the menu, chilled mango, 
pineapple and champagne soup. 
And it tasted just as superb as it 
sounds. 

There were greetings from 
some unable to attend for various 
reasons: Bob Barnes, Carl Desch, 
Ed Fischetti, Harry Friedman, 
Larry Gussman, Winston Hart, 
John Kluge, Duke Marchese, Bob 
McMillan, Don O'Connell, Ker- 
mit Pines, Bill Roveto and Joe 
Salinger. They hope to be there 
when we do it again next summer, 
and we'd like to count you in, too. 
We'll keep you posted. 

George Hoyns recently moved 
from Tranquility, N.J. to Rifle, 
Colo. We hope George's move 
isn't a prediction of America's 
future. 

We've also heard from our dis¬ 
tinguished jurist, Dan Friedman. 


Although retired, Dan still aver¬ 
ages about 35 hours a week, sit¬ 
ting on the Federal Circuit. 

Our world-famous ecologist, 
Barry Commoner, argued in a 
recent Nezvsday article that preven¬ 
tion, not control, is the best and 
least costly way to defeat pollu¬ 
tion. He points out that banning 
lead in gasoline reduced lead 
emission by 98 per cent, while cat¬ 
alytic converters have been much 
less successful (24 per cent) in 
reducing carbon monoxide. Barry 
calls for investment in electric 
vehicles, solar energy, and greater 
recycling.

elect of the American Bar Associ¬ 
ation's Senior Lawyers' Division 
Pro Bono Committee. He is 
actively practicing law with a 
legal services firm in White 
Plains, in poverty-affected issues 
such as tenants' rights. Useful 
work and many clients. 

Bob Blanc is doing much the 
same for the Legal Aid Society.

Norris Smith has written a book 
on interpretations of art: Here I 
Stand—Perspective from Another 
Point of View. It is a study of the 
ways in which pictorial structure 
in Western painting embodies 
meaning. 

The class extends its sympathy 
to Bob Senkier, whose wife Mary 
passed away on May 27. She had 
been a volunteer and member of 
the Columbia-Presbyterian Hos¬ 
pital Auxiliary for 23 years.

Walter Berger... "the best part 
was seeing so many old friends 
and classmates," a frequently 
repeated comment, as was his 
assessment that "the function

CLASS NOTES 


Columbia College Today 



The men of '40 talk about...women 


The Class of '40 discussed "Women and Men in Communications & the Arts: Now and In the Future" at its 55th 
reunion. Panelists (left to right) were Richard Heffner '46, host of "Open Mind" on PBS and former chairman of 
the motion picture industry's ratings board; Seth Neugroschl '40, strategic planner at IBM; moderator Daniel 
Edelman '40, chairman and co-chief executive officer of Edelman Public Relations Worldwide; his daughter, Renee 
Edelman, the firm's senior vice president and deputy director, global technologies; and Rita Pietropinto '93, gradu¬ 
ate student in the Theater Arts division of the School of the Arts. The soberest assessment came from Mr. Heffner, who 
found that the further women rose in the arts professions, the more likely they were to assume the least attractive char¬ 
acteristics of their male counterparts.

Germany, Austria and Hungary." 

Lawson Bernstein... "Seth, 1 
shall treasure this always" (the 
Columbia Lion we awarded him 
inscribed: In Appreciation of Your 
Inspired Leadership and Dedica¬ 
tion as Class of 1940 President 
1990-1995). 

Ellis Gardner also received a 
token of our appreciation for all his 
efforts in leading and motivating 
the class during his many years as 
Class President. 

Wilber "Rally" Dennis reports 
on his first reunion in almost 60 
years with Anson "Andy" Bow¬ 
den and their wives; both attend¬ 
ed the Barnard School before 
Columbia, then kept in touch via 
Christmas cards. A visit by Andy 
from Texas to a relative in New 
Hampshire was the occasion; 
Rally—who missed our 55th—is 
considering coming in 2000. 

For Ed Ethel "the chance to 
get together with Berktold, 
Gardner, and Snepp" and the 
Emanuel Ax '70 concert were 
Reunion highlights. 

Bill Feinberg reports on a July 
visit with Shirley to England and 
Scotland, as part of a group of 
Federal and state judges, to com¬ 
pare legal systems with counter¬ 
parts there. 

Don Jacoby sent me a warm 
note regretting his lack of com¬ 
munication with me and other 
classmates over the years ("some¬ 
how WWII and Engineering dis¬ 
connected me from my College 


experience"). He expressed sor¬ 
row on learning of Bob Lubaris 
death, recalling that they had 
been high school classmates, 
admiring Bob's later accomplish¬ 
ments, and remembering a lunch 
with him in London in 1972. Now 
that you've broken the ice, Don, 
how about an update on you? 

Ira Jones reports that despite 
emeritus status as Clinical Profes¬ 
sor of Ophthalmology, he's still 
active as consultant to Harkness 
Eye Institute and at Harlem Hos¬ 
pital. "I missed Russ Tandy, 

Chet Hall and Phil Krapp," he 
says, adding, "How about the 
class photo?" (I'll have to get an 
answer to that!) 

Alan Kattelle is "still guiding 
the Movie Machine Society, strug¬ 
gling to complete my book on the 
history of home movies... love to 
hear from any alumnus with sim¬ 
ilar interests." 

Jim Knight, Don Kursch and 
Asher Hiesiger are all involved 
with and concerned about Ed 
Rice, who has been in New York 
University Hospital fighting off 
Parkinson's disease. Ed is back 
home in Sagaponack, L.I., work¬ 
ing on three books. 

Albon Man: 'To me the most 
impressive part of the Reunion was 
Dean Kathryn Yatrakis's presenta¬ 
tion. Her description of the 1995 
student body convinced me that 
the glories of Columbia are now 
and in the future, not in the past." 

Jack Naylor: "Our 55th was 


great... Much thanks to Hector, 
Lawson and the committee." He 
commented on the number of 
attendees who'd been active in the 
class 55-60 years ago: "good 
group." Jack did have one com¬ 
plaint.. . "I didn't receive some 
recognition for my three sensational 
seasons at the Bamard-John Jay 
Coffee Dances." Maybe at our 60th? 

Seth Neugroschl: "Gerry and I 
just returned from several won¬ 
derful—and depressing—weeks 
in Mexico City and San Miguel 
de Allende, visiting old friends 
and seeing firsthand the impact 
of the country's financial crisis on 
the Mexican people." 

Harry Walker, in good engi¬ 
neering fashion, sent a six-point, 
meticulously structured and pos¬ 
itive Reunion assessment. He 
was particularly pleased (as was 
I) that the Engineering School 
Reunion ran in parallel with the 
College's, permitting us to attend 
events in both. He intends to 
attend our 60th, and offers "an 
obvious suggestion for 2000: rele¬ 
vance of a 20th century education 
and background to life in the 
next decade or two."

Bob Dettmer, Ann and Jim Dick, 
Cynthia and Art Friedman, Betty 
and Art Weinstock; also Fanny 
de Bary, who delivered congratu¬ 
lations from Ted de Bary, at that 
time in the Far East. This brings 
the total of classmates awarded 
this medal to seven. 

On June 16-18, the class held 
its 54th Reunion at Arden House. 
In attendance were Helen and 
Fred Abdoo, Clarice and Joe 
Andrews, Mary Louise and 
Hugh Barber, Ruth and Stan 
Bedford, Hermaine and Charles 
Cohen, Fanny and Ted de Bary, 
Ann and Jim Dick, Cynthia and

Henry (Dzimek. 

Via Joe Coffee comes news of 
Hugh K. Barber, recently honored 
by Columbia, with the John Jay 
Award, and by St. Jean Baptiste 
Community Center in New York 
City. Hugh is director of obstet¬ 
rics/ gynecology at Lenox Hill 
Hospital. Again in the news is 
Dick Kuh, former district attor¬ 
ney of New York County, appoint¬ 
ed by a New Jersey Surrogate 
Court as special investigator into 
the circumstances surrounding 
the death of Doris Duke. 

From Sherwin Kaufman, 
retired from the practice of 
medicine, comes word of a new 
career—he is now a songwriter. 
Edmund White writes from Silver 
Spring, Md., that he is about to 
retire from the Navy. A chemical 
engineer, he is expert in the area of 
fuels, fuels stability and flamma¬ 
bility. Joe Peters, in Philadelphia, 
formerly a hospital administrator, 
notes that he is now launched on a 
new career as a professional artist. 
He has had several shows at gal¬ 
leries and at least one museum. 
Congratulations! 

This column wishes a speedy 
recovery from physical problems 
to Margaret, wife of Joe Coffee, 
and to Dorothy, wife of Charles 
Newlon. Both would undoubtedly 
enjoy hearing from friends. 

We mourn the passing of Wil¬ 
fred Howitt of Little Silver, N.J., 
and John K. Barry of Bryn Mawr, 
Pa. and extend deepest sympathy 
to their wives and families. 

Finally, thanks to all of you 
who have sent news of yourselves 
and of other classmates. That is 
what keeps this column going.

Vic Zaro, who keeps up with 
everyone, as you know, sent along 
the first two items: Hal Stenson 
has retired after a 49-year teach¬ 
ing career at Smith College. Hal 
stays in shape and fills his time 
with gardening and reading. 

Dick Davies, formerly U.S. 
Ambassador to Poland, has main¬ 
tained his interest in foreign affairs 
and makes a contribution as board 
member of an institute working to 
resolve international disputes. 

Jack Arbolino's moving recol¬ 
lection of old friends, published 
in CCT last winter, added push to 
a drive for a memorial to those 
alumni who died in World War 
11, as well as for some form of 
recognition by the College of all 
who served. 

While listening to public radio 
recently, 1 heard a lengthy inter¬ 
view with Donald Keene. Now 
University Professor Emeritus, 
Donald lives part of the year in 
Tokyo. A widely recognized 
scholar of Japanese culture, he 
continues to publish in English 
and Japanese. His discussion 
brought me new insight into the 
current state of U.S.-Japanese 
relations. 

Charles West is now retired, 
but like so many of us is more 
active than ever. He lives in Rin- 
goes, N.J. Don Seligman contin¬ 
ues to enjoy his retirement; he has 
moved to Somers from Rhinebeck. 
Sid Silberman continues to prac¬ 
tice law, lives in Westchester and 
travels as much as he can. We saw 
Sid over Labor Day weekend at a 
50th anniversary party for Phyllis 
and Larry Bangser. 

And a final personal note: This 
summer, my wife and 1 celebrat¬ 
ed our own 50th anniversary at a 
party given by our three sons. 
Joining us were six members of 
the class: Jerry Green, Jerry Klin- 
gon, Mel Hershkowitz, Jack 
Arbolino, Bob Chemeff, and 
Larry Bangser, all except Bob 
accompanied by their wives.

With deadline fast approaching, I 
received a phone call from Kem 
Young, who continues to enjoy 
the condo life in North Carolina. 
Once an avid gardener, he now 
concentrates on his golf swing. 
Wife Edna is no slouch on the 
greens, either, for between the 
two of them they have a 
respectable collection of mantel¬ 
piece gewgaws to show for their 
efforts. Kem reports that occa¬ 


sionally they have the pleasure of 
playing with Ruth and Ken Ger- 
mann, who also live in retirement 
in the Tar Heel State. 

Speaking of golf, Don Steven¬ 
son says that he gets in an occa¬ 
sional round with Bud Dillon, as 
both live in the Syracuse, N.Y. area. 
Don is semi-retired, still handling 
some accounts for the McMillan 
Company, publisher of ledgers and 
other record-keeping forms. He 
was an officer with the company 
before taking up a life of relative 
ease. Don's ties with Columbia are 
still there. He sees as many football 
games as he can and handles inter¬ 
views of prospective upstate stu¬ 
dents for the College. 

Einally, a note from Bill Webb, 
who is retired from General Elec¬ 
tric and living in Louisville, Ky: "1

Julianne passed away in January 
1995 after years with Alzheimer's

Dr. Joshua Lederberg—our gifted 
Nobel laureate, ex-president of 
Rockefeller Univ. and active 
geneticist, is honorary chairman 
of the November 16th Alexander 
Hamilton Dinner honoring all of 
Columbia's Nobel nobles. It 
should be a prideful and memo¬ 
rable gathering. 

Dr. Ira W. Gabrielson—his 
distinguished work on the class 
directory eliciting widespread 
and nearspread kudos in '44 
Land. Though winter is near, 
hats, coats, scarves and spats off 
to this outstanding physician, 
teacher, computer ace and geo- 
mancer. 

Mort Lindsey—^building on his 
glory days with the Blue Lions, 

Dr. Lindsey has completed his 
first 31 years as director of music 
operations of the Merv Griffin 
Group. While his polo playing 
has moved down the comprehen¬ 
sive Lindsey agenda, he is active¬ 
ly painting and has works in the 
collections of Barbra Streisand, 
Burt Bacharach, Van Cliburn, 
Merv Griffin, Pia Zadora, Les 
Brown, and other show-biz/arts 
nabobs. If you don't get to those 
living rooms, he's exhibited in 
Malibu, Carmel, Palm Springs, 
and Atlantic City. 

Mrs. Judy Lindsey, a.k.a. Gold¬ 
en Tonsils, is heard on record 
singing "Joltin' Joe DiMaggio" in 
Ken Burns's TV series on baseball. 

David G. Sacks—continuing 
his extensive work in philan¬ 
thropy, the former president of the 
Seagram empire and still v.p. of '44 


has seen his intelligent, practical 
and significant 18-page report on 
"Welcoming the Intermarried into 
Your Jewish Pamily" published by 
the Jewish Outreach Institute, c/o 
CUNY Graduate School at 33 West 
42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10036, or 
phone (212) 642-2181. 

Author Sacks, who is president 
of the Institute, has had his pam¬ 
phlet described as a "must read" 
as well as "sensitive and well 
thought out" by notables. An 
additional career as a non-fiction 
writer may be on the horizon. 

Leonard Koppett—the revered 
sports scribe and worldly 
philosopher has been roving the 
land as honored guest and savvy 
participant in a series of academic 
conferences and seminars on pro 
athletics. As he moves forward to 
finish his classy single-volume 
baseball history, 44's unique 
member of both the baseball and 
basketball halls of fame has been 
named to the Veterans' Commit¬ 
tee which selects new members 
for the Baseball Hall of Eame at 
Cooperstown. 

Lt. Col. Donald P. Mitchell— 
the Tigard, Ore. resident is retired 
but remains very active in philat¬ 
ely. Exhibiting in international 
shows and writing articles, this 
former star of the Columbia Col¬ 
lege "Eilatelikus" club recently 
received the Distinguished Philat¬ 
elist Award from the Northwest

County Waterford, Ireland. The 
wordly Jordans visit the W.I. 
biannually. 

Henry R. Hecht—the author, 
publicist and financial poo-bah 
edits the newsletter of the Colum¬ 
bia alumni in his part of the New 
Jersey veldt. H.R. off shortly to 
inspect Australia and New 
Zealand, a lovely couple. 

Harold Polton—has enjoyed 
publication of his essay on his 
war-time education at Columbia 
and then at Univ. of Iowa, where 
he was freighted by ASTP. He's 
also enjoyed his son Richard's 
25th Reunion (class of '70), his 
ample family, ongoing activity in 
real estate management and recent 
purchase of a pied-a-terre on West 
72nd Street in Manhattan for visits 
from his abode in New Jersey. 

PS.—the dreamers, cut-purses 
and irridentists who didn't get 
around to sending forms for the 


class directory may have a second 
chance before excommunication. 
Since we're thinking of a better- 
late-than-never supplement, we'll 
probably send out the forms again.

The 50th Reunion of the Class of 
'45 was a howling success! The 
staff outdid themselves in every 
way! One interesting develop¬ 
ment was the combination of the 
Engineering Class of the "war 
years" with the Columbia Class 
of '45. We were consequently out¬ 
numbered, but not greatly so. 

Here is the lineup: Enoch 
Callaway, Herbert Erlanger, Jack 
Falsone, Jerome Heller, Herbert 
Hendin, Walter R. Holland, 

Julian B. Hyman, Sheldon E. 
Isakoff, Richard Kates, Harold 
B. Kaufman, Charles A. Kiorpes, 
Joseph Lesser, Herman Levy, 
William McClarence, Herbert 
Margoshes, V. Peter Mastrorocco, 
Marvin Mausner, Henry F. 
O'Shaughnessy, William Riely, 
Lester Rosenthal, Albert J. Roth¬ 
man, Warren Saunders, Howard 
Schmertz, Chester J. Semel, 
Clarence Sickles, Eugene Sill- 
man, Michael J. Ucci, and Myron 
H. Weisbart. Our ladies graced 
the occasion and enjoyed the 
weekend. 

One little amusing note. The 
College Glee Club sang Saturday 
night at the banquet in Faculty 
House. One song was "Who 
Owns New York?" But they left 
out the verse: "Who sweeps the 
streets?" When we asked why, we 
were told they had never heard of 
it. Times do change. 

News was received from 
George T. Wright, who retired in 
December as an English professor 
at the University of Minnesota. 

He has moved to Tucson, where 
he swims, plays tennis, writes and 
stays in good health like his 101- 
year-old-bridge-playing mom. 

Julian B. Hyman has retired 
from active medical practice but 
continues to teach oncology at the 
Roosevelt division of St. 
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital. He is 
a trustee of the Print Club of New 
York, which commissions an 
artist to make a print each year, 
with members receiving a copy of 
a limited edition. He and wife 
Elaine visit three children and 
five grandchildren in Newtown, 
Mass., Tenafly, N.J., and Oakland, 
Calif. Julian says he is looking 
forward to our 55th Reunion. 

Let's all make that a goal. 

Our honorees this time are all 
the guys and gals who attended 
our glorious 50th!

There was a gathering on June 15 
to set plans for our 50th Reunion. 
In attendance were Carlo Celia, 
Howard Cohen, Harry Coleman, 
Fred Escherich, Chuck Fabso, 
Dave Feder, Pete Miller, Mike 
Pincus, Irv Sherr, Don Summa 
and Bemie Sunshine. 

We had lengthy discussions as 
to the location of the Reunion. By 
now you will all have received a 
questionnaire about your choices. 
Some key dates to keep in mind 
are May 14, which is the College 
Class Day, and May 15, which is 
Commencement. On both of these 
days the 50th Reunion Class is 
expected to turn out and march in 
the processions. 

Prior to this affair, 1 attended a 
50th celebration with the 1945 
crew which brought out several 
of our classmates, namely Walt 
McVicar, Graham Kiscadden and 
Ed Taylor. Graham now lives in 
Cheyenne, Wyo. and raved about 
the great life out west. Ed Taylor 
reports that Clinton James Taylor, 
the first grandson, was born on 
July 8. The '45 crew, by the way, 
voted to "reune" every spring 
from now on. 

1 had a visit with George 
Gilbert and his wife, Anne, when 
they visited their daughter in 
New Canaan. The Gilberts 
sounded as if they were on a golf¬ 
ing tour since the clubs were 
swinging all over the North. 
George now lives on St. Helena's 
Island in South Carolina. 

A letter from Harry Garbett 
contained the following para¬ 
graph: "After, gulp, 42 years in 
dentistry, 1 have finally seen the 
light (popular demand) and 
retired. As Yogi Berra says, 'When 
you see a fork in the road, take it.' 
I plan to travel, to test this and 
that out, and plain 'let it go,' 
except as Satchel Paige says, 'Do 
not stop or slow down, someone 
may be gaining on you.' 1 am a 
very fortunate man, for life has 
been much better than 1 ever 
thought it would be." Harry wish¬ 
es he saw more classmates at the 
'94 Homecoming game. Hopeful¬ 
ly, he will join us at Reunion and 
catch up with many old pals. 

Attallah Kappas received the 
University of Chicago's profession¬ 
al achievement citation at that uni¬ 
versity's 1995 Reunion in June. 
Attallah, a 1950 graduate of the 
University of Chicago Medical 
School, is Sherman Fairchild Profes¬ 
sor at Rockefeller University, where 
he served for many years as vice- 
president and physician-in-chief. 

A call from Howard Clifford 
informed me that he is now living 


in Soft Springs, Wyo., where he 
runs an Irish sing-along bar cater¬ 
ing to the local tribes. He says the 
regulars really weep after a rendi¬ 
tion of "Mother Machree." Howard 
somehow got hold of a copy of the 
Winter 1994 Rutgers Magazine that 
had an article titled "The Life and 
Times of Richard Heffner." Dick 
teaches "Mass Communications 
and the American Image" at Rut¬ 
gers. Howard wants Dick to come 
out to Wyoming and change his 
image—good luck. 

Keep those cards and letters 
coming in.

To the legions who communicate 
regularly with your correspon¬ 
dent, please note the minor 
change of address above: from 
apartment #21-A to apartment 
# 6-D. All else remains the same. 
(At my age, I can't take that 
many stairs anymore.) 

Welcome back! Two '48ers 
exiled into other classes via unin¬ 
tended oversights are now back 
in the fold: Bob Stocker (Morton, 
Ill.), recently retired, and Walter 
Wallace, professor of sociology at 
Princeton University. Both 
expressed interest in reconnecting 
with Columbia friends with a 
particular eye to our 50th 
Reunion. 

Bob McNaughton retired from 
the computer science department 
of the Rensselaer Polytechnic 
Institute in 1989, but continues as 
an active professor emeritus in 
that department. 

Compliments: for Columbia Col¬ 
lege Today from J. Fred Patten 
(Shreveport, La.), "I look forward 
to every issue;" and from Richard 
D. Clark (Vero Beach, Fla.), "I am 
delighted that the Toastmaster's 
Club is taken seriously at 
Columbia." 

Based on 35 years of experi¬ 
ence as a professional U.S. diplo¬ 
mat, a book by Monteagle 
Steams, Talking to Strangers: 
Improving American Diplomacy 
Abroad, will be published by the 
Princeton University Press. 
According to the author, "The 
book analyzes the American 
diplomatic method and recom¬ 
mends ways to improve it." Prob¬ 
ably a very big book. 

Let's do lunch. A Once-Every- 
Month-Or-So-Manhattan-Lun- 
cheon-Club includes regulars 
Dave Brainin, Bob Clayton, 


Myself, and any others we can 
lure into our company. A recent 
session, for example, included 
Ken Bernstein, en route from his 
home in Lausanne to a family 
wedding and reunion in Wiscon¬ 
sin. Ken continues to turn out 
travel guidebooks, currently as 
chief writer for JPM Publications. 

Also enjoying the luncheon 
was Dr. John Butler (moonlight¬ 
ing from the Class of '47), still a 
practicing pediatrician in the 
Oranges in New Jersey. John, it is 
worth noting, has three sons and 
five daughters. 

If you care to sample these 
salons, feel free to call Myself for 
the next scheduled date and loca¬ 
tion. An agenda might typically 
include solving the problems of 
the world, family updates, read¬ 
ings from Modern Maturity and 
how much tip to leave. 


Joseph B. Russell

Jay Fernandes writes from Costa 
Rica that he looks forward to 
attending our 50th Reunion (as 
do most of us, one suspects), not 
ever having been to any up to 
now. He has, since retiring in 
1982, been doing volunteer work 
for the International Executive 
Service Corps, whose local office 
he opened, serving as country 
director through 1985. His princi¬ 
pal current activity is that of an 
owner/grower of a macadamia 
processing plant in Pococi, C.R., 
which keeps him off the streets 
and out of the poolroom, and 
makes him some money, he 
reports. To all of you in Central 
and South America, take notice 
that Jay has accepted the post of 
reunion committee chairman for 
your part of the world. We look 
for exciting results. 

While in San Francisco for a 
few days in May, your correspon¬ 
dent tried to get David Ilchert to 
come into town for lunch, with¬ 
out success—in the wee hours of 
the very morning we spoke, his 
daughter-in-law had been deliv¬ 
ered of a son, and Dave and 
Wanda were not sure whether 
they would drive or fly, later that 
day, to visit their new grandson. 
So, instead we spent about an 
hour on the phone rehashing old 
times and old friends. Dave 
retired over a year ago from his 
post as district director of the U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization 
Service for Northern California, 
an agency he served for some 37 
years, and he has no regrets; he 
seemed especially pleased to be 
exposed no longer to the status of 
defendant in every lawsuit 
brought against the agency in 
that part of the world, but admits 


missing the convenience of hav¬ 
ing a secretary always available 
to bring him a fresh cup of coffee. 
Wanda says he's perfectly able to 
make his own. 

Alfred Scherzer writes from 
Hampton Bays, N.Y, that he has 
recently become clinical professor 
emeritus at Cornell University 
Medical Center and continues with 
his practice, developing a regional 
clinical center for handicapped 
children in eastern Long Island, 
and—what else?—teaching. 

Dick von Glatz, who retired in 
1988 after a career in book pub¬ 
lishing and in the Foreign Service, 
keeps busy with volunteer activi¬ 
ties in the Washington, D.C. area. 
He has been interviewing high 
school students for the College 
and finds them to be, by and 
large, "a superior bunch. It 
restores my faith in today's 
youth." He has been trying to get 
in touch with Ed Carranza, who 
was reported here as asking 
about Dick, but has had no suc¬ 
cess in locating an address or 
phone. As I do not keep the mate¬ 
rial sent to me for this column, I 
cannot refer to Ed's note, but Ed, 
if you see this, Dick's address is 
7313 Golden Iris Ct., Springfield, 
Va. 22153, and he is anxious to 
hear from you ASAR 

A well-wisher who attended 
law school with many of us, Jim 
Devaney '50 writes from Plant 
City, Ha. with best regards to '49 
in general and George Cook and 
Art Feder in particular, and sends 
his condolences to Stan Harwood. 

Please let me have your news so 
that our old friends can share it.

Alfred Arees has completed 40 
years in the publishing business, all 
in international sales and market¬ 
ing. He has headed his own export¬ 
ing/buying agency since 1975. (AI 
and I occasionally meet. He shows 
no sign of slowing down.) 

Aristotle Roussos has decided 
to leave the running of Dundee 
Mills to other folks and has retired. 
Ari and Mary have moved to their 
newly built home on a lake in Sar¬ 
dinia, Ohio. 

Had a nice letter from Vincent 
X. Smith. He and his wife have 
been in Oklahoma City for 30 
years. Vince is retired from the 
Little Giant Pump Company, but 
is active doing some marketing 
consulting. 

A phone call from Ernest 
Thiesing was a pleasant surprise. 
We had a long chat; I've forgotten 
what we said about whom, but it 
was fun. Ernie is now living in 
Monticello, N.Y, and is retired 
from Abbott Labs. His family

includes three children and four 
grandchildren. 

Charles Young wrote to report 
that earlier this year he and his 
wife had visited Korea, Okinawa 
and China. A lot going on with 
Charles: His new novel. Luck of 
the Draw, is being published in 
Canada and is being translated 
into Japanese. The novel is an 
account of the last major Pacific 
campaign of World War II. 

Charles signed with a Greek pub¬ 
lisher to publish an espionage 
thriller, and it may even be made 
into a miniseries—in Greek. Good 
luck with your projects, Charles!

Now is the time to start thinking 
about our 45th Anniversary 
Reunion. It will be held on cam¬ 
pus on the weekend of May 31- 
June 2,1996. Make a note on your 
calendar. 

Class President Bob Snyder 
has sent a letter to all class mem¬ 
bers with reunion information. He 
has enclosed a reunion question¬ 
naire. If you have not sent in your 
reply, please do so as soon as pos¬ 
sible. The information on the 
questionnaire will help the com¬ 
mittee in selecting appropriate 
events for the weekend. The suc¬ 
cess of the Class Reunion effort 
largely depends on the strength 
and scope of the Reunion Plan¬ 
ning and Fund committees. Why 
not volunteer for one or both of 
these groups? 

Along with Bob's letter you 
should have received a list of 
classmates whose whereabouts are 
unknown. If you know their cur¬ 
rent addresses, please drop me a 
note so that we can add the miss¬ 
ing to our reunion mailing list. 

Joan Rose and Candice Work¬ 
man, representatives from the 
Alumni Office, will be assisting 
our class with reunion plans. In 
the event you have not received 
information from Bob Snyder, 
please call Joan or Candice at 
(212) 870-2743. 

Many of our classmates have 
expressed concern about ever- 
increasing taxes and the cost of 
living for "maturing" alumni 
members and spouses. Recently 
we heard from Robert Nielsen. 
Bob had a long career in the Air 
Force and is now retired in Mont¬ 
gomery, Alabama. In a recent 
note he pointed out numerous 
reductions in benefits to veterans 
and requested that we all keep in 
touch with our representatives in 
Washington regarding changes in 
the Social Security program. 

Joe McCormick did not last 
long as a "retiree." After one year 
of the good life, he reentered the 


work force by joining Dataflow, 
Inc., a reprographics company in 
Binghamton, N.Y. 

Your correspondent, George 
Koplinka, and his wife. Peg, are 
off to see the National Parks: 

Zion, Bryce Canyon and Grand 
Canyon. The telephone answer¬ 
ing machine will be left on, so call 
(914) 592-9023 with newsworthy 
items for this column.

Trowbridge H. Ford reports from 
Portugal that the first volume of 
his biography of Henry Brougham 
has been published in England. 
Ford expands on the Ph.D. thesis 
he wrote in 1967 and fills in a lot 
of details about Brougham, whom 
he considers to be the "most 
underestimated politician of the 
19th century in Britain." Ford is 
working on the second volume 
while he soaks up Portugal's sun, 
wine and food. 

This year Gene Manfrini again 
completed a 38 V2-mile bike-a- 
thon in 3 V 2 hours on a tandem 
bicycle to raise money for Free¬ 
dom Guide Dogs. He did this 
despite impending back surgery. 
His next project is to invent the 
PAINLESS BICYCLE SEAT. 

Dick Pittenger is approaching 
retirement from ABC Television, 
and he and Eileen have their sights 
set on a nice house on Cape Cod. 

We hear, via the grapevine, 
that Lois and Art Leb now have 
seven grandchildren. 

Speaking of grandchildren... 
(what a segue).. .in the previous 
issue of CCT you were told by 
this reporter that Evelyn and Bob 
Kandel were going to be grand¬ 
parents, and now they are. Vivi¬ 
enne and Russell are the proud 
parents of Dalton Glenn Kandel. 
(With a name like that, you just 
know he will have to write 
romance novels.) Of course, he is 
absolutely the cutest thing 
around! 

Feeling run down? Tired of 
hearing the same old thing about 
me? Then send in some lively bit 
of news for me to put in this space.

undergraduates, Don and Valerie 
are probably our class's longest- 
married couple. They have three 
sons and one grandson, and are 
enjoying semi-retirement living 
on the banks of a restful river in 
Maryland. Don writes books and 
newsletters concerning the latest 
trends in education. A number of 
years ago, Valerie was catapulted

This column represents quality 
but not quantity. Bret Charipper 
retired from IBM after 31 years as 
a consultant and educator in office 
systems and procedures. Bret and 
his wife Elaine celebrated their 
40th wedding anniversary this 
past June. They are living in Chap- 
paqua, N.Y. Let's hope that we can 
all help them celebrate at our next 
June reunion. I wonder how many 
of our classmates have June wed¬ 
ding anniversaries. 

I received a copy of an article 
written by John Casella that 
appeared a number of years ago 
in the Athol, Mass. Daily News 
describing how, as a freshman, 
John and Ike (of Eisenhower 
fame) celebrated their mutual 
birthday. It was great reading. 

Someday, when you least 
expect it, you may receive a 
phone call which will result in 
your being in the '54 Class Notes. 
Until then, please write.

There has been much happening 
on campus this fall with all the 
construction taking place and the 
students returning to school at 
the end of August (a little earlier 
than we started our school year). 
We welcome the class of 1999 
(whew!). They all look so 
young—reminding us of another 
group (albeit all male) which 
entered the school 44 years ago. 
However, they don't have to 
worry about the soph-frosh rush 
or the famous greased pole; but 
Freshman English—that's another 
story. The construction and reno¬ 
vations which began in the spring 
are still proceeding apace. The 
old gym has been converted into 
a state-of-the-art facility to 
accommodate all the activities 
being performed to keep the stu¬ 
dents and faculty and their fami¬

Columbia College Today 



Largest turnout ever 

Holding forth at his 40th reunion was Jerry Sherwin '55, who was instru¬ 
mental in the gathering of some 200 classmates, wives and assorted guests — 
an all-time attendance record for an anniversary class. For the senior vice 
president at Bozell Jacobs, the turnout was the latest triumph of a lifetime of 
alumni activity; Mr. Sherwin is president of his class, former president of the 
Varsity "C" Club, an Alumni Federation medalist, vice president for athletics 
of the Alumni Association, chairman of the Friends of Columbia Basketball, 
and, perhaps most prestigious of all, class correspondent for Columbia Col¬ 
lege Today.

will aid the new sports being 
added to the athletic program. 

The new Dean of Columbia 
College, Austin Quigley, has taken 
over his duties. Our class was for¬ 
tunate to meet him during the 
Reunion weekend and learn 
about his vision and plans for the 
College. There is little that has not 
been said about the most success¬ 
ful Reunion in Columbia history. 
We saw Richard Ravitch looking 
for his old roommate, Marty 
Salan, who flew in from San 
Francisco; there was Bill Epstein, 
with Bob Banz and Ivan Leigh, 
talking up a future weekend at 
Arden House; then the dramatic 
singing Saturday night of the 
Columbia "Oldies but Goodies" 
led by Aaron Preiser, Marvin 
Winell and Stuart Koback; there 
were our heroes of yesteryear— 
Bill Mink, Bob Tuthill, John 
Naley, Ron McPhee, Tom Bren¬ 
nan, Neil Opdyke, Jack Freeman, 
Jack Armstrong, Tom Chrystie, 
Bob Hanson, and others; there 
were Jules Rosenberg and 
Bernard Schwartz back to campus 
after many years; and most of all, 
our all-star group of speakers— 
Barry Sullivan, Martin Gottfried, 
Stanley Lubman, and Harry 
Scheiber. 

Regrets were sent by Arthur 
Rosett (who was in Tokyo, but 
will be at the 50th—what hap¬ 
pened to the 45th?), Harvey 


Solomon (traveling in Australia), 
Beryl Nusbaum (stranded in 
Rochester), Gordon Kaye (con¬ 
flicts kept him in Albany), Char¬ 
lie Sergis (sent special regards to 
Ferdie Setaro, Aaron Ham¬ 
burger, John Helmers, and Evans 
Gerakas), Monte Manee (another 
conflict), Eddie Goldberg (still at 
Tufts after all these years), A1 
Lerner (let us know through Jim 
Berick that he will be at the next 
big event), and Harold Kushner 
(conflict in Natick—not the name 
of his new book). Harold, by the 
way, received a very prestigious 
award from the Christophers, 
which is celebrating its 50th 
anniversary. As part of this cele¬ 
bration, the organization honored 
50 people, of whom HK was one, 
who have made the world a nicer 
place during the last 50 years. 
Other recipients included Jimmy 
Carter, Mother Theresa, and 
Ralph Nader. 

Thanks go to Lew Stemfels, 
who took a major number of pho¬ 
tos which will be forwarded to the 
appropriate classmates. (Lew will 
keep the negatives, however.) The 
Class Directory, with the help of 
the Alumni Affairs Office, has 
been distributed to everyone. In 
the haste to get the book out to the 
class, there have been a couple of 
misprints which will be corrected. 

We learned from Walt Flana¬ 
gan in Danvers, Mass, that he is a 


Doctor of Medicine and that the 
"Jr." should be deleted from his 
name. Walt joined the Columbia 
Club of New York and hopes to 
visit the city more often. Another 
omission of an M.D. title was for 
Elliott Gross, who still resides in 
and around New York. Let us 
know if there are any other 
changes, additions, deletions, etc. 
and an addendum will be sent 
out forthwith. 

Carrying over from the 
Reunion was a gala event at the 
Illustrator's Club hosted by Norm 
Goldstein and his wife, Ramsay. 
It's a long way from Honolulu. (Is 
that a World War I song?) 

Other news from arormd the 
country: Donald Lehmkuhl, 
retired in Ocala, Ha. since 1984, 
had been doing a little bit of writ¬ 
ing. He last published The Zeppelin 
Stamps, a history and catalogue, 
and was awarded a silver medal 
for his efforts in San Francisco. 
Holding the proverbial fort in 
Brooklyn, home for the Los Ange¬ 
les Dodgers, is Stanley Friedman, 
who practices at the SUNY/Health 
Science Center there. Stanley was 
one of the many Bronx Science 
graduates in our class. Donald 
Kuspit, who was going to lecture 
at Reunion until he was abruptly 
called away to Europe on business, 
is a professor of art fiistory and 
philosophy at SUNY Stony Brook. 
The Stu 3 rvesant grad keeps in 
touch with our own Anthony Vis- 
cusi. Did you know that Bob 
Schoenfeld's avocation is photog¬ 
raphy? Bob, who practices with the 
Plainview Medical Group on Long 
Island, recently had a show at the 
National Arts Club in Gramercy 
Park. Very successful, I might add. 
Frank Pike, who is retired, main¬ 
tains homes on Prince Edward 
Island (Canada) and in Venice, Ha., 
with a home base in Nineveh, Ind. 
Erank rarely sees any classmates 
(maybe because he travels a lot 
from home to home). However, if 
anyone appears in Canada, Horida, 
or Indiana, give Frank a call. 

From Jeffersonville, N.Y., but 
now living a very gratifying life in 
North Babylon, Long Island, is 
Lud Dosch. If you want to know 
what's happening with Dan 
Hovey and Ed Francel, ask LD. 

Stanley Zinberg is director of 
practice activities at the American 
College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists in our nation's cap¬ 
ital. The Lincoln High School 
graduate stays in touch with 
Harry Weinstein and Elliot 
Gross from time to time. 

It was terrific to see all classmates 
who attended our 40th and to hear 
from all those who couldn't make it. 

The next newsletter announc¬ 
ing the mini-events over the next 
several months will be in your 
hands shortly as well as some 


assorted tidbits of news. 

Stay well. Watch your diet. 
Keep exercising. Use sun block. 
Remember to eat lots of roughage. 

You guys are the greatest. Love 
to all. Everywhere!!

We have been gearing up for our 
40th Reunion, and by the time 
you read this, we will have com¬ 
pleted our second planning meet¬ 
ing. I must observe that I have 
never experienced such interest in 
the 20-plus years I have been 
working on our reunions. Our 
planning committee is expanding 
by leaps and bounds, which is 
good and which we encourage. 

New faces at the planning 
meeting were A1 Broadwin, Lou 
Hemmerdinger, Warren Good¬ 
man, Lenny Wolfe and Bob 
Siroty. Others who plan to be 
active include Art Salzfass, who 
was very helpful in sending us 
the results of a Harvard Business 
School reunion questionnaire. 

This will be forwarded to our 
longtime loyal committee mem¬ 
ber Larry Gitten, who could be 
working with old reliable Mike 
Spett on the Reunion yearbook. 

Don Morris (of Jester fame) has 
promised to help me add some 
humor and insight to our class 
letters, which will make my loyal 
readers breathe a sigh of relief.

George Beliak got an offer he 
couldn't refuse this year, a terrific 
buy-out, and retired from the 
N.Y.C. Board of Education after 
more than 32 years. His last job 
was working with high school 
dropouts, guiding them back into 
education and a chance within the 
system. His wife, Elizabeth, retired 
as well, after 26 years teaching; 
their son, Andrew, a stock trader, 
and daughter, Alexandra, a writer 
for W magazine, are reported to be 
pleased to have Mom and Pop to 
play with again. 

But George has mixed feelings 
about his good deal. At 60, secure 
in pension and benefits, he is free 
to "carpe diem," as he says, teach 
some English courses at the Col¬ 
lege of New Rochelle, read and 
travel. But the seductive buy-outs 
were part of the demolition of 
public education and the city; now 
there are fewer, less experienced 
and less expensive teachers for 
more students. 

Facing his first fall without an

overcrowded public school class 
to teach, George was waxing 
philosophical. " 'You are your life' 
is a phrase that has always stuck 
with me," he said. "You are not 
who you think you are, but what 
your behavior demonstrates. 
Beyond that, just roar, lion, roar." 

Alfred D. Fierro hasn't retired, 
he's just made his life easier. Al, 
who practices law in Fort Lee, 

N.J. brought his sons, Matthew 
and Mark, into the firm. Howev¬ 
er, this may be their punishment, 
since he reports that "unfortu¬ 
nately, one went to Tufts and the 
other to Villanova..." 

As you recall from the last ish, 
Alan Frommer and his son, Ben 
'91, rafted down the Colorado 
River and then went on to Las 
Vegas, where the old man won 
and the kid lost. What did they 
learn from such a great adven¬ 
ture? Well, Ben went on to Har¬ 
vard for a Ph.D. in modern Euro¬ 
pean history and Al kept traveling 
to enjoy "the post-tuition years." 
(Daughter Michele was '86.) 

Along the way, Al ran into Frank 
Corral, and his wife, Nancy. So 
what did Al learn from that? 

'T found out why he passed 
Spanish and I had to take a third 
semester. His parents spoke Span¬ 
ish at home—^mine Yiddish." 

Talk about native intelligence.

Congratulations to Ernie Brod, 
who has been appointed execu¬ 
tive managing director of Kroll 
Associates, the international 
investigative and security con¬ 
sulting company. In addition, 
undoubtedly inspired by Ernie's 
service as sports editor of Specta¬ 
tor, Ernie's son, Jonathan, has 
been named manager of con¬ 
sumer products for NBA Canada, 
Inc., which means he is in charge 
of selling caps, t-shirts, etc. for the 
new expansion teams in Toronto 
and Vancouver; merchandising 
has been a phenomenally success¬ 
ful sideline for the league. 

While channel-surfing one 
night, your editor came across a 
Nova rerun entitled "The Secret of 
the Wild Child" that featured 
Harlan Lane discussing his book. 
The Wild Boy of Aveyron. Harlan, a 
professor of psychology at North¬ 
western University, has written 
extensively on the learning 
process in deaf and other dis¬ 
abled children.

Last June's 35th Reunion was 
lively and pleasurable. In fact, 
even the planning process (under 
the leadership of Richard Fried- 
lander) was rewarding, as the 
planning committee agreed it 
would be fun to continue a class 
meeting on a regular basis, just to 
keep in touch. The time is noon, 
the first Thursday of every 
month, and the place is Michael's 
on 55th Street, just east of Third 
Avenue. All classmates are invit¬ 
ed to drop in—no reservations 
necessary but you can call 
Richard at (212) 310-0765 for 
information. 

One possible first at the 
reunion was an exhibition of 
work by four classmates in the 
very handsome St. Paul's crypt 
gallery space. Paul Nagano 
exhibited a fine group of water- 
colors and Claudio Marzolo 
(who organized the exhibition) 
showed sculptures. Robert A. M. 
Stem and Norman Hildes-Heim 
presented a selection of their past 
architectural projects. No one 
could remember a College class 
presenting a similar exhibition, 
and viewers from other classes 
expressed interest in organizing 
similar projects for their future 
reunions. 

The day included two stimu¬ 
lating presentations, one on reli¬ 
gion in America today with Rabbi 
Laurence Rubinstein and the 
Rev. Karl Donfrie, followed by 
an enlightening discussion with 
some College undergraduates, 
and the other a revealing look at 
representing athletes and other 
celebrities by William Goodstein. 
Bill was in the news daily, at least 


here in New York, as he negotiat¬ 
ed with the infamous George 
Steinbrenner on behalf of one of 
his best known clients, Darryl 
Strawberry. Strawberry was sub¬ 
sequently signed by the Yankees. 

The first reunion of the Reunion 
actually took place in the Dahesh 
Museum, your correspondent s 
new institution at Fifth Avenue 
and 48th Street. The opening of 
our second exhibition drew some 
of the classmates mentioned above 
plus John Bell and Steve Lemer 
(along with a good representation 
of spouses). 

Flarry Taylor writes to propose 
a cmise reunion between regular 
five-year activities. Harry, retired 
in Cinciimati after 28 years at 
Procter & Gamble, now devotes 
some of his time to the travel 
industry. He'll organize it if any¬ 
one is interested. Contact him at 
his office, (800) 489-4824, or home, 
(513) 451-9583. 

Judith Chute B'60 reports the 
death last September of Robert 
Camso. In addition to Judith, his 
first wife, he is survived by three 
children: Pamina, Monica, and 
Nicholai. 

My former roommate and 
Spectator colleague Pat Mullins 
'59 always told me to avoid 
sports cliches in writing straight 
news, but it is hard to avoid 
something like "Terrence McNal¬ 
ly sweeps the boards" in last 
year's drama awards. A year after 
his Tony for Kiss of the Spider 
Woman, Terrence won big for his 
current play. Love! Valour! Com¬ 
passion! —including Tony, Drama 
Desk and Outer Critics Circle 
awards. 

Meanwhile, playwright and 
Smith College professor Leonard 
Berkman notes productive activi¬ 
ty during a sabbatical last year. 
His play, I Won't Go See a Play 
Called "A Parent's Worst Night¬ 
mare," was given a public reading 
at N.Y. Stage and Film Co. with a 
distinguished cast and director. 
He also continues play develop¬ 
ment at Sundance, Wordbridge (a 
Sundance offshoot) and at N.Y. 
Stage and Film. He believes "the 
state of American theatre can be 
so easily underestimated!" Son 
Zak is in New York, working at 
the Manhattan Theatre Club, 
where most of Terrence McNal¬ 
ly's plays are first produced.

It was good to hear from Larry 
Wittner, who is currently teach¬ 
ing courses on the history of U.S. 
foreign policy at SUNY-Albany. 
Larry had previously taught at 
Hampton Institute and Vassar 
College, as well as at Japanese 
universities. He is the author or 
editor of seven books and many 
articles and reviews. 

Over the last 10 years, Larry 
has been working on a trilogy 
entitled The Struggle Against the 
Bomb. The work is a history of the 
disarmament movement. The first 
volume. One World or None, deals 
with the post-war period through 
1953 and has won the Warren 
Kuehl Prize of the Society for 
Historians of American Foreign 
Relations as the outstanding book 
(published in 1993 or 1994) on the 
history of internationalism 
and/or peace movements. Larry 
expects that the second volume. 
Resisting the Bomb, covering the 
years 1954 to 1970, will be pub¬ 
lished within the coming year. 
Best of luck, Larry. 

From Ann Arbor, Ed Surovell 
is alive and well and running the 
area's largest residential real 
estate brokerage company. He has 
done a 180-degree turn from his 
earlier career in the editorial 
world. Ed spends his "leisure 
time" in local politics and arts 
philanthropy. Both his children 
got married last year. 

It is always a pleasure to hear 
from Crawford Killian, who con¬ 
tinues to publish, putting out four 
books in 1995 alone. A revised ver¬ 
sion of his novel Brother Jonathan, 
and his fantasy novel, Redmagic, 
are two of the works. He will also 
soon finish 2020 Visions: The 
Futures of Canadian Education and 
The Communications Book, a text¬ 
book on workplace writing. 

Crawford is an active Columbia 
recruiter in the Vancouver area. 

He would love to hear from any 
classmates and has provided us

Columbia College Today 


Scourge of the academic left 


T he vaguely left-wing 
sounding Center for 
the Study of Popular 
Culture has its head¬ 
quarters in West Los 
Angeles, just across the street 
from Simon Wiesenthal's Muse¬ 
um of Tolerance. It's actually a 
neoconservative / libertarian 
affair whose principal mission 
is attacking political correctness 
in the contemporary academy 
and what it regards as left-wing 
bias in Hollywood and public 
broadcasting. 

The most visible—certainly 
the most voluble—representa¬ 
tive of this operation is David 
Horowitz '59, the center's presi¬ 
dent, a short, energetic man in 
his mid-50's who sports a Trot- 
skyesque goatee. The author 
(with his long-time collaborator 
Peter Collier) of a series of best¬ 
selling histories of the Rocke¬ 
feller, Kennedy and now Roo¬ 
sevelt dynasties, Mr. Horowitz 
has taken an ideological 
odyssey from student radical¬ 
ism at Berkeley, anti-war and 
black power activism—in the 
early 70's he was an ardent sup¬ 
porter of the Black Panther 
Party, a commitment that ended 
abruptly when a friend was 
murdered by the group—to his 
present position as implacable 
foe of the left in all its remain¬ 
ing manifestations. 

His current stance has 
brought him the enmity of his 
former friends and comrades, 
and enthusiastic welcomes from 
William F. Buckley, Norman 
Podhoretz '50, Senator Robert 
Dole, and Dinesh D'Souza, 
author of Illiberal Education, who 
writes approvingly of Horowitz 
and Collier as "terrifyingly com¬ 
petent ideological warriors." 

His new friends also include 
an assortment of right-to-lifers 
(Mr. Horowitz is himself pro- 
choice), fundamentalist Chris¬ 
tians, and Newt Gingrich 
enthusiasts. Their individual 
donations, along with the con¬ 
tinuing munificence of the Olin 
and a variety of other right- 
wing foundations, help keep the 
Center and its several periodi¬ 
cals in business. 


Heterodoxy, (circulation 
15,000), the most incendiary of 
these, was created to denounce 
and ridicule the many trends 
Mr. Horowitz and his allies 
decry, among them multicultur- 
alism, radical feminism, post¬ 
structuralism, Afro-centrism, 
gay and lesbian studies, speech 
codes, "sensitivity" and "diver¬ 
sity" training, and affirmative 
action, which last Mr. Horowitz 
has called "racism pure and 
simple: the worst social legisla¬ 
tion in this country in the last 
thirty years." Heterodoxy's 
polemical journalism is conduct¬ 
ed with sanguinary glee, in a 
manner that Mr. Horowitz him¬ 
self acknowledges is reminiscent 
of the New Left diatribes he and 
Peter Collier used to publish in 
Rainparts, the radical magazine 
they edited in the 1960's and 
early 70's. Indeed, with its crude 
line drawings, sexual humor, 
scare headlines—"Multicultural 
Mafia," "Women's Studies 
Imperialists," "Afro Fascism on 
the Rise"—and its insistent, 
coarse use of invective. Hetero¬ 
doxy bears a much closer resem¬ 
blance to a typical 60's "under¬ 
ground" paper than anything a 


conservative foundation might 
care to fund. That's fine with 
Mr. Horowitz. "I've self-con¬ 
sciously retained the style of the 
New Left," he explained. "I 
want progressives, so-called, to 
feel the heat that they've put on 
people so that they can under¬ 
stand other people's attitudes 
towards them." 

n the phone and 
again when inter¬ 
viewed in his office, 
Mr. Horowitz cred¬ 
ited his Columbia 
education with whatever inde¬ 
pendence of mind he has exhibit¬ 
ed since graduation, either as a 
yoimg man attempting to formu¬ 
late an alternative to the ideologi¬ 
cal traditions of the Old Left, or 
now, as a declared opponent of 
what he sees as equally stultifying 
orthodoxies on the nation's cam¬ 
puses. "I loved my Columbia 
education," he declared. "The 
humanities, the canon—the dread 
canon," he mused, shaking his 
head in mock incredulity. "Com¬ 
ing to Columbia, and the first 
week reading the Iliad —what 
could be more exciting?" 

Mr. Horowitz breathed the air 


of ideological certainty at an 
early age. His parents were both 
"card-carrying Communists," as 
he put it, and his father died "a 
Brezhnevite." For the young 
Horowitz, raised exclusively in 
Sunnyside, Queens, which he 
described as "an enclave of Jew¬ 
ish communists surrounded by 
Irish and Italian working-class 
fascists," the atmosphere of his 
classrooms at Columbia proved 
irresistible and intoxicating. 
There were new ideas, new 
ways of talking and thinking, an 
eye-opening C.C. curriculum 
that included von Hayek's The 
Road to Serfdom along with a 
provocative pairing of Marx and 
the Russian terrorist Nechayev's 
Catechism of a Revolutionary. 
There was Shakespeare with 
Andrew Chiappe '33 and James 
Zito '48 and a seminar with 
Steven Marcus '48. 

Mr. Horowitz, true to his 
upbringing, regularly turned in 
Marxist papers for all his class¬ 
es, but, he says, he was "never 
once made to feel like a pariah" 
by the Columbia faculty, who 
despite their own largely liberal 
and anti-Communist views 
were tolerant and encouraging. 
"I think they were probably 
social democrats," Horowitz 
remarked of his old teachers, 
"pretty left-wing but anti-Com- 
munist. They made a strong 
case for both sides. If they were 
teaching Marx it was to illumi¬ 
nate the ideas and the positions, 
not to give you the 'correct' 
line." It is this spirit of tolerance 
and intellectual flexibility, along 
with the content of the core 
courses he studied in the 1950's, 
that Mr. Horowitz alternately 
charges is under severe threat 
or has actually been destroyed 
at American institutions of 
higher learning. 

"I think the universities 
today are less free than they 
were in the McCarthy period," 
Mr. Horowitz declared. "In 
those days it was Congressional 
witch hunters. Now the witch 
hunters are on the faculty. It's 
the professors who are enforc¬ 
ing the line."

1994, and is now employed at 
Stanford University in the Center 
for International Security and 
Arms Control, specializing in 
Russian defense conversion and

Suzanne, graduated from the 
University of Rochester in June, 
and remains at Rochester study¬

Published in the New York 
Observer on April 10 was a com¬ 
ment regarding Lars-Eiik Nelson, 
then of Newsday, now back with 
the Daily News : "I don't know 
why Lars-Erik Nelson of Newsday 
isn't better known. He is consis¬ 
tently smarter and funnier than 
conventional D.C. columrusts, a 
genuine iconoclast among pre¬ 
dictable drones. Maybe he's too 
subtle to make it in the self-pro¬ 
moting McLaughlin Group sound¬ 
bite punditocracy but he's always 
worth reading and they're not."

On a personal note, your corre¬ 
spondent succeeded this summer 
in bicycling 192 miles in the Pan 
Mass. Challenge, a bike ride from 
Sturbridge, Mass, to Province- 
town at the tip of Cape Cod, all 
for the Dana Farber Cancer Insti¬ 
tute. I can report that it was a 
great thrill to get so much mileage 
out of this "over-50" body.

As the new academic year started, 
memories of Columbia undoubt¬ 
edly stirred as many of us, some 
for the first time, sent a son or 
daughter off to college or rejoiced 
at a recent graduation. Arthur 
Lew captured the feeling when he 
wrote from New Rochelle, N.Y: 
"As exciting as it was to graduate 
from Columbia 31 years ago, that 
was surpassed by the thrill of 
attending Commencement cere¬ 
monies [in May] when our 
daughter Jennifer received her 


diploma from the College. For 
those of you who haven't seen it 
lately, campus is as beautiful and 
elegant as ever, and the spirit of 
the students as lively. It was reju¬ 
venating to be there!" 

Writing from Breckenridge, 
Colo., Bob Nash disputes the 
claim to the "youngest retiree" 
title made by Barry Shapiro in my 
last column. Bob's credentials: he 
retired in 1992 from Phillips Petro¬ 
leum Co., "dabbled a bit in estate 
planning and insurance" for a 
year or two, and then moved to 
Colorado "to pursue such chal¬ 
lenging activities as skiing, bicycle 
riding, mountain hiking, and 
building a new home." Nomina¬ 
tions are still open, so let me hear 
from you. 

Happenstance has provided 
some material for the column. I 
ran into Gary Schonwald on the 
platform of the Lexington Avenue 
subway. He's practicing law in 
New York City, with an emphasis 
on intellectual property. He's also 
seeking admission to the bar in 
England, and pronounced the 
examination the most difficult he 
has ever taken. While vacationing 
in Vermont I also ran into Steve 
Solomon, who had just spent the 
weekend canoeing. He, too, is 
practicing law in New York City. 

Finally, before leaving for a 
three-week gastronomic tour of 
France with Herman Kane '61 
and family in July, Steve Singer 
described over dinner each 
mouth-watering step of the way 
as I followed along with a Miche- 
lin guidebook. Steve is the direc¬ 
tor of college counseling at the 
Horace Mann School in New 
York City, where he has achieved 
a national reputation for excel¬ 
lence. This year 10 Horace Mann 
graduates are part of the Col¬ 
lege's freshman class.

Our class celebrated its 30th 
Reunion at Columbia on June 
2-4. A highlight was a class-only 
session with David Denby where 
he reviewed his personal impres¬ 
sions of revisiting the core cur¬ 
riculum, including observations 
of his fellow (undergraduate) stu¬ 
dents and the faculty members he 
encountered on his return to 
Columbia. We're looking forward 
to his book. 

The Reunion was well attend¬ 
ed. The following classmates 
were registered or present (apolo¬ 
gies for any omissions): Donald 
Bachman, William Brenner, 
Allen Brill, Michael Cook, 
Robert Donohue, James Fleisher, 
Ralph Freidin, Dean Gamanos, 
Louis Goodman, Laurance 






Richard M. Newman '65 has been 
appointed executive vice president 
and general counsel of Amalgamated 
Bank of Chicago, a 73-year-old firm 
with $500 million in assets. Most 
recently a partner in the banking and 
financial institutions practice of the 
Chicago-based law firm Mayer, 
Brown & Platt, Mr. Newman has 
also served as vice president and 
associate general counsel of Chicago's 
Continental Bank. A1968 graduate 
of the Law School, Mr. Newman is a 
member of the American and Chica¬ 
go Bar Associations. He lives in Oak 
Park, 111., with his wife, Lilian.

Martin Shulman, James Siegel, 
Donald Smith, Neil Smith and 
Garland Wood. Many members 
of the class from the School of 
Engineering, spouses and friends 
also attended. 

One of the pleasures of a 
reunion is encountering people 
who had disappeared from view 
for years, like David Lionel 
(Klorfine). He is a video producer 
and editor and runs his own pro¬ 
duction company in Malibu, 

Calif. He told us that for another 
producer he has done a pilot 
hosting a TV talk show billed as 
"an answer to Rush Limbaugh." 
David hopes to present to a wide 
audience a whole range of posi¬ 
tive alternatives to current prac¬ 
tices, from holistic health care to 
green taxes to strengthening and 
democratizing the United 
Nations. After earning an M.A. in 
English from U.C. Berkeley, 

David led a "utopian spiritual 
community" named "The Eternal 
Family" from 1967 to 69. In 1977,

David Lindeman writes to us 
from Washington, D.C.: 

"Because Bill and A1 made me 
an offer I could not refuse, I 
'retired' from the government last 
year, most recently as policy and 
research head at the Pension Ben¬ 
efit Guaranty Corporation. I am 


now the executive director of the 
1994-95 Social Security Advisory 
Council ('reemployed annuitant'), 
trying to help a group of 13 citi¬ 
zens figure out solution(s) to that 
minor issue. In October, I join the 
World Bank as a social insurance 
and pension guru. Hope to have 
better luck abroad than at 
home..."

Parthenon replica. Chuck Lieppe 
enthusiastically informs that 
"things continue to go superbly

Please call if you're in town and

music!" 

Quoted in an article about 
Republicans in Hollywood, 
appearing in the Daily News this 
spring, Ben Stein, the former 
Nixon speech writer turned 
screenwriter, contends, "There's 
always been an informal blacklist 
against Republican writers." 

Our assiduous correspondent, 
Joe Cody, writes on Ritz-Carlton 
Laguna Niguel stationery that he 
attended the Gold Football dinner 
honoring the 1994 team. "It was a 
stirring evening at which the 
graduating seniors shared their 
feelings about being part of the 
first team with more victories 
than losses in many years. Joining 
me at our table were fellow '66ers 
Bill Corcoran, currently teaching 
in the Hospitality School at the 
University of New Hampshire, 
and Roger Denis, who is with the 
Board of Education in Lawrence, 
Long Island. Many thanks to Lion 
Immortal Billy Campbell '62, who 
brought us together for that 
evening. 

"Wife Molly and I had a won¬ 
derful visit to Nantucket, where 
we attended a delightful party 
hosted by John Doody and lovely 
wife Carol. Off-islander Harvey 
Kurzweil and Arne Jensen (origi¬ 
nally '66, but who knows when 
he actually graduated) were spot¬ 
ted in the crowd, as was Rich Ver- 
meire, class of '66 at Rutgers, 
who, my freshman roommate Stu 
Hawkins will remember, spent 
more time living with us than he 
did in New Brunswick. 

"I don't know who does your 
editing, but please remind him 
that the demonstrative pronoun 
(this, that, these, and those) must 
refer to a specific noun immedi¬ 
ately preceding it. Also, my NEX 
friends were far more than 
friends, they were brothers. You 
see, unlike Bob Myerson, I never 
passed a weekly grammar quiz 
and strive constantly to attain 
grammatical exactitude." 

Sorry, very esteemed assiduous 
correspondent, but I was obliged 
to change your "whom" to "who" 
in the reference to your Rutgers 


friend, and also to write "remind 
him" instead of your "remind 
them" in the paragraph above. So 
much for your vaunted "gram¬ 
matical exactitude."

Finally! Over a dozen members of 
the Cleverest Class in the World 
have contacted us since the last 
CCT went out (with eloquent 
silence re '67). With appreciation 
we relay their news. Words to 
console Galveston medical pro¬ 
fessor Dave Bessman fail us: son 
Daniel "had a complete tour of 
the Columbia campus including 
dinner at V&T, but [became] a 
plebe" at the Naval Academy. 

Nor was Minneapolis attorney 
Roger Clarke's summer that 
bright. He damaged his favorite 
elbow in a header on Hennepin 
Avenue over the handlebars of 
his bicycle. This impairs not only 
his tennis game, but his ability to 
drink to forget his tennis game. 
Talented daughter Melanie, how¬ 
ever, starts at American Universi¬ 
ty this fall. When Congress can¬ 
celled the Super Collider project, 
astronomer Tom Dombeck 
moved from Texas to the Univer¬ 
sity of Chicago to build a tele¬ 
scope in New Mexico (the logic 
here escapes us). Daughter Heidi 
is a senior at Northwestern and 
son Daniel a class of 2000 
prospect. Kent Hall is seeking a 
publisher for his latest work. The 
Definitive Bridge Book. This eclectic 
work has chapters on dentistry, 
Goren's bidding system and 
architecture (featuring detailed 
maps of To-Ko-Ri, San Luis Rey, 
Madison County and the River 
Kwai). Upper Saddle River, N.J., 
commodity broker Michael Jack- 
son notes that daughter Rachel is 
'99, although his wife and he did¬ 
n't see Columbia as the place for 
her. "It just must be destiny," he 
says. His twin brother A1 Jackson 
continues at First Boston as 
research director and recently 
taught securities analysis at the B- 
School. Dave Bessman's Galve¬ 
ston colleague and general bon 
vivant Gordon Klein, A.B., M.D., 
M.A. (cantab.), S. of K., is now 
revising the U.S. Pharmacopeia 
and teaches pediatrics. (George II 
would be proud.) More patrioti¬ 
cally, this July 4th marked Sum¬ 
mit, N.J., thoracic surgeon and 
P&S prof Jerry LozneEs—and 
wife Barbara's—25th wedding 
anniversary. Their progeny are 
Amy, a consultant with Arthur 
Andersen; Josh, '96—a Lion varsi¬

school prospect—and Stacy, an 
Upper at Exeter. Nutmeg Stater

National Center for Missing and 
Exploited Children, was a recipi¬ 
ent of the Lubavitch Youth Orga¬ 
nization's Humanitarian Award. 
Clinton advisor Richard Morris 
was wordsmith William Satire's 
target in a June 19 New York Times 
op-ed essay. We hear that Reed 
Moskowitz now heads the NYU 
Stress Center. (Richard: why not 
call Reed?) Marty Oster teaches 
oncology at P&S and lives in 
Armonk with wife Karen. They 
are "proud [of] and thrilled with" 
their daughters: Bonnie '99, 
Michelle and Nancy. Jenik Radon 
is an academic sponsor of note. 
Under the Eesti Fellowship pro¬ 
gram he helped to create, 15 Col¬ 
lege students work each summer 
as interns in Estonia. Jenik has 
also placed students in India (e.g., 
daughter Kaara '95), Japan, and 
Ukraine's Republic of Crimea. 
Alumni/ae of these programs 
have gone on to P&S, the J- 
School, Georgetown Law, and, 
sadly. Harvard, while several 
have won Marshall Scholarships, 
and one, a Rhodes. Peter Shaw, 
an Army Corps of Engineers 
economist for ages, writes from 
his new home, "I like Texas... I 
mean, after New York City, what 
else is there?" He has kept up 
skills honed by the Glee Club by 
singing in Albuquerque's Opera 
Southwest and an Irving, Texas 
chorus. He and wife Phyllis see 
their 12-year-old, Jonathan, as 
"seriously cool." Want to see more

A reunion recital by Emanuel Ax '70 

Emanuel Ax '70, the internationally celebrated concert pianist, made some joyful noises at his 25th reunion when he 
performed before a packed and appreciative audience in the Miller Theatre on June 3. Nearing the conclusion of his 
hour-long set, he asked the assembled, "How about a Chopin waltz?" and received a roar of approval. Earlier this year, 
Mr. Ax won the 1995 Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Soloist Performance, for his Sony Classical recording of 
Haydn's Piano Sonatas Nos. 32, 47, 53, and 59.

With the new term beginning, 
there are a growing number of 
classmates with a child in the 
College. John Herbert, however, 
wonders "how many alumni can 
claim three generations at Colum¬ 
bia College!" John's father, Benne, 
graduated in 1932, and his 
daughter, Amy, is a member of 
the Class of '98. 

Congratulations to Nick Garau- 
fis on his appointment as chief 
counsel for the F.A.A. Nick had 
long been responsible, on behalf of 
the borough president, for all avia¬ 
tion issues in Queens County 


relating to Kennedy or LaGuardia 
airports. He is closely monitoring 
the performance of the airline sys¬ 
tem by commuting each week 
from his home in Queens to his 
office in Washington. 

I report the sad news from 
Christian Ward that his wife, 
Ginny, died on May 28. 

Jeff Schwartz writes that he 
and his wife—both professors— 
will be on sabbatical during the 
spring term of 1997 (talk about 
advance planning!) and intend to 
spend it in New York City. 

Indeed, they are looking to sublet 
an apartment on the Upper West 
Side, or in the Village or TriBeCa. 
Jeff is a professor in the depart¬ 
ment of anthropology at the Uni¬ 
versity of Pittsburgh (and gives 
his e-mail address as 
jhst@pitt.edu.). 

What would a Class of 1969 
report be without an item on Paul 
Auster? Since our last column. 
Smoke —credited as a film by 
Wayne Wang and Paul—opened 
to glowing reviews. Paul wrote 
the screenplay, which was 
inspired by his New York Times op¬ 
ed piece in 1990 entitled "Auggie 
Wren's Christmas Story." Smoke — 
apart from its own good 
reviews—gained industry atten¬ 
tion for another reason; a sequel. 
Blue in the Face, was shot in six 
days in a particularly improvisato¬ 
ry style as the work on Smoke was 
concluding. Congratulations to 
Paul on this latest triumph.

My plea for reports on where our 
classmates were on the night of 
April 23,1968 ("the bust") was 
largely ignored. Perhaps this 
request was as stale as the term 
"bust" is now. In any event, I did 
receive two reports. Lewis 
Siegelbaum wrote that he was 
the recipient of nine stitches 
while on Low Plaza that evening. 
Fortunately Lewis healed and 
went on to study Russian history, 
which he now teaches at Michi¬ 
gan State. He recently co¬ 
authored Workers of the Donbass 
Speak: Survival and Identity in the 
New Ukraine. The book is based 
upon interviews with coal miners 
and their families from 1989 
through 1992. 

Michael Jellinek also respond¬ 
ed. He reports that he was duped 
by one of the faculty members to 
stay off campus on the night in 
question and, accordingly, missed 
the festivites. He is currently an 
associate professor of psychiatry 
(pediatrics) at Harvard Medical 
School and senior vice president 
for ambulatory services at Massa¬ 
chusetts General Hospital. 

I'll provide you with a detailed 
post-25th Reunion report in my 
next column. Suffice it to say that 
the reunion was a resounding 
success. Special thanks to my 
brother Betas (Ken Alexander, 
Craig Archer, Dennis Graham, 
Bill Poppe, Phil Russotti, Jack 


Richmond, Terry Sweeney and 
Chuck Vagel) who showed up in 
force and provided much of the 
good spirit that prevailed 
throughout the weekend. 

As usual, I look forward to 
receiving updated information on 
all of our class members. 

So, please drop me a line or 
give me a call.

Ron Rosenberg (Professor of

It's hard to believe that gradua¬ 
tion was 25 years ago! This fall 
my son, Jacob, will begin as a 
freshman at the College—that, 
too, is hard to believe. Are there 
any other classmates with chil¬ 
dren starting at Columbia College 
or the Engineering School this 
fall? Best wishes to all." 

Yes, there are. Milt Erman is 
"happily ensconced in Southern 
California (never having thought 
I would live in a town with the 
word 'beach' in its name [Solana 
Beach]); delighted to have my 
second child entering the College 
this fall [first child is a sopho¬ 
more at the College]. Busy with 
combination of clinical practice, 
teaching and research; dealing 
with the 'challenges' of managed 
care and its impact on the future 
of health care. Relax with tennis, 
hiking and skiing."

ing and servicing patients as a 
commodity. I can't tell from the 
job description, but maybe look 
up Jerome P. Erhlich, "married to 
Norma (Princeton '74), 3V2-year- 
old-boy computer game addict 
(he's addicted to my playing). I'm 
an internist and medical director 
at Sudler & Hennessey, a health 
care agency (subsidiary of Young 
& Rubicam), specializing in 
health care communications." 

A more unfortunate health care 
communication relates to P. C. 
Hamlin, who notes that "in direct 
relation to the recent news in The 
New York Times, July 8-9,1995, 
wherein Columbia Presbyterian 
Hospital is eliminating Cardiolo¬ 
gy and probably other depart¬ 
ments, due to budget tightening, 
cardiologists, neurologists and 
dentists such as myself are unem¬ 
ployed and looking for work. The 
current state of the economy is 
very important to alumni, CCT, 
and past, present and future." 

A cardiologist still employed is 
Jeffrey Matos, "in charge of the 
Cardiac Electrophysiology Dept, at 
Lenox Hill Hospital. My wife and I 
live in New Rochelle with our 
daughters Amanda and Lindsay." 

One response to managed care 
is the growth of larger medical 
practices. Stanley Leff has "been 
president of my medical group— 
135 M.D.'s—for the last five 
months. Recently I've been taking 
courses in medical group manage¬ 
ment and have been participating 
in several metric century bicycle 
rides here in Northern California. 
My wife Marian recently helped 
launch a family practice residency 
at her hospital." 

You could even bank on it. Ray 
Strieker is "associate medical 
director of a blood banking orga¬ 
nization in California, also 
involved in AIDS research. Hap¬ 
pily married, two kids." 

A. J. Kuntze "and Libby con¬ 
tinue to live beside Puget Sound 
in the 'Valley of the Magic Skag¬ 
it.' I practice Indian Law for the 
Swinomish Indian Tribe while 
Libby gets paid to teach people 
about birds, butterflies, wildflow- 
ers, whales and the natural 
world. We live a blessed life! [in 
Laconner, Wash.]." 

I'm sure he'd have a lot to talk 
over with Paul Kroskrity, who 
"last year published my first 
major book. Language, History and 
Identity, and gave an invited lec¬ 
ture at the International Congress 
of Americanists meeting in Stock¬ 
holm on the subject of threatened 
American Indian languages. This 
year I signed a contract with 
Oxford University Press to co-edit 
a book on language ideology. I 
continue to be a Professor of 
Anthropology and Chair of Amer¬ 
ican Indian Studies at UCLA. " 


Also coming to a bookstore 
near you: Joshua Rubenstein's 
"biography of the Soviet writer 
and journalist. Tangled Loyalties: 

The Life and Times of Ilya Ehrenberg, 
will be published by Basic Books 
in February 1996.1 worked on this 
project for over a dozen years. My 
wife Jill is hard at work on a four- 
part series for public television 
about art and censorship called 
Challenging Art." 

Taigen Dan Leighton reports 
that a "book I co-translated and 
edited, Dogen's Pure Standards for 
the Zen Community, will be pub¬ 
lished by the State University of 
New York Press late 1995.1 am 
currently teaching at the Berkeley 
Graduate Theological Union, and 
leading the Bolinas Zen Sitting 
Group." 

Someone who has a place for 
sitting groups to sit is Peter 
Stamberg, whose firm, Stamberg 
Aferiat Architecture, in New 
York, is "currently designing pro¬ 
jects in Columbus, Indiana 
(school). New York (medical 
offices and apartments). East 
Hampton (houses). A sofa we 
designed was introduced by 
Knoll this year." 

While sitting, have a drink, 
and come back to books. Bennett 
A. Weinberg is "currently com¬ 
pleting Caffeine: Science and Cul¬ 
ture, to be published in 1996 by 
Johns Hopkins University Press, 
telling the colorful cultural stories 
of coffee, tea, and cola, and pre¬ 
senting the latest scientific 
research on the health impact of 
the world's most popular drug." 

A more shotgun approach to 
writing is that of John Kuhn 
Bleimaier, who "writes a regular 
column for the car magazine Jour¬ 
ney, contributes articles to shot¬ 
gun sporting magazine Sporting 
Clays) publishes articles in the 
Hague Yearbook of International 
Law, planted 60()0 blue spruce at 
'Falkenhorst.'" 

Jeffrey Weinberg writes, "In 
June, at a special ceremony and 
celebration of the 25th Anniversary 
of the founding of the Office of 
Management and Budget, I was 
presented with the office's highest 
honor by Director Rivlin. The Dis¬ 
tinguished Service Award was "for 
outstanding contributions over six 
Presidential Administrations in 
managing the legislative clearance 
process on behalf of the OMB 
Director and the President.' (I 
started at OMB as a summer intern 
during college.)" 

Other news of note from Wash¬ 
ington: Lenny Glynn married the 
former Mary Kane on June 17. 

The ceremony took place at 
Georgetown's historic Holy Trini¬ 
ty Church, followed by a recep¬ 
tion at the Sulgrave Club. A num¬ 
ber of Columbia friends attended. 


including Jamie Katz '72, John 
Prados '73, Kevin Mathewson '80 
and Phil Ozdemir '81E. Now 
director of industry affairs for the 
State Street Bank of Boston, 

Lenny is a veteran reporter for 
such magazines as Time, 
Newsweek, Business Week, 
MacLean's and Institutional 
Investor. A former speechwriter 
for the Dukakis and Clinton pres¬ 
idential campaigns, he recently 
completed a stint as top speech- 
writer for Secretary of Trans¬ 
portation Federico Pena. 

Edward Gray writes: "The 
Orphan Trains, an historical docu¬ 
mentary I directed and produced 
(with my partner, Janet Graham) 
will air nationally on the PBS 
series. The American Experience, on 
November 27. It tells the story of 
the 100,000 orphaned and neglect¬ 
ed children who were relocated 
from city to country during the 
19th and early 20th centuries." 

Lawrence Weiss "recently 
received the Outstanding Teacher 
Award from the School of Inter¬ 
national Service at American Uni¬ 
versity where I teach as an 
adjunct in addition to my work 
[Director, Chinese Studies Pro¬ 
gram] at Sidwell Friends School. 
My son Shennan is studying Chi¬ 
nese in high school, and I enjoyed 
taking him to Beijing last summer 
[1994], where he provided com¬ 
puter guidance on our consulting 
visit to a new school being started 
there. Wendy and I celebrated our 
25th anniversary [June 1995]. 

Time marches." 

With sadness I note that time 
marched too fast for Arwin 
("Andrew") Bittern, who died on 
August 21. More details on the 
retired vice president of 
Citibank—a musician who 
remained active in the arts, music 
and directing, stage-managing 
several off-Broadway produc¬ 
tions—will be forthcoming in the 
obituary column. 

Remember: Reunion is May 
31-June 2.1 look forward to see¬ 
ing many classmates there.

world is Bill Hudgins, editorial 
director for Hammock Publish¬ 
ing, a custom publishing firm in 
Nashville. His principal projects 
include Road King, a magazine for 
long-haul truckers, and work for 
the National Federation of Inde¬ 
pendent Business. The future 
looks digital to Bill: "CCT needs

The ever-prolific Michael Shapiro 
writes of much good news. He and 
Theresa Vorgia B'75 now have 
three sons; his book The Jewish 100: 
A Ranking of the Most Influential 
Jews of All Time is now in its fourth 
printing and is being translated 
into (!) Bulgarian; his musical 
pieces have been performed in 
Berlin, Vienna, Washington, D.C., 
Boston and Vermont, with an 
upcoming performance at the U.S. 
Holocaust Museiim (where he is a 
consultant) of his Guitar Concerto, 
written when he was a freshman at 
Columbia; and he has just finished 
a documentary film score to be 
aired soon in Israel and on Channel 
4 in London. The rest of us can 
barely get up in the morning! 

Jim Thomashower has moved 
to Alexandria, Va., where he is 
the executive v.p. of the National 
Society of Public Accountants. 

The big news, though, is that he 
and wife Penny Brickman trav¬ 
eled to China in November 1994, 
where they adopted Sarah Ji 
Yuangdong Thomashower, who 
will be 2 years old in January. 
Congrats, Jeem. 

Darrell Panethiere had been 
working for the Justice Depart¬ 
ment and the Senate Judiciary 
Committee for the past nine 
years. He recently made a big 
move—to the U.K.—to practice 
international copyright law; 
somewhat logical since his wife, 
Jane Johnson, is English (and a 
children's book author). He is 
working as a legal advisor to the 
International Federation of the 
Phonographic Industry, 54 Regent 
St., London WIR 5PJ, and he 
invites all classmates to get in 
touch. Also Over There is Louis 
Keyes, living with his family in 
Reims, France. Louis is v.p. for 
global sales and marketing for 
Seagram's Champagne Group— 
Mumm, Perrier Jouet, and Heid- 
sieck brands specifically. One 
wonders what he drinks for a 
special celebration. 

While musing, wondered if 
Steve Hermides could replace 
Jerry Garcia. One never knows, 
do one?

As the years go by, it seems that 
more and more of the class is 
finding that the only good person 
to work for is oneself. Be it entre¬ 
preneurial zeal or the end result 
of corporate downsizing, I am 
hearing from a large number of 
classmates in diverse fields who

have left the bosom of "the big 
corporation" in order to form 
their own companies. 

An early emigre from big busi¬ 
ness was Ashoka Varma, who, 
after working for a big law firm 
and later as the chief financial offi¬ 
cer of a big firm, decided to form 
Varma & Associates in New York, 
where he can pursue a wide vari¬ 
ety of business ventures. He 
recently wrote me that he "just 
completed a fun year-and-a-half 
turning around the original Ted 
Turner media entity in Atlanta as 
president of the company." He 
seems to now have found a num¬ 
ber of other media and entertain¬ 
ment "deals" that are occupying 
his time. 

Brad Higgins has abandoned 
Corporate America to start his 
own firm. Brad had been at 
CS/First Boston doing investment 
banking, and left to become a 
senior partner of a new firm 
called Cambridge Partners, L.L.C. 
He was honored recently as one 
of seven new members of the Col¬ 
lege's Board of Visitors. As noted 
in my last column, he joins War¬ 
ren Stem in this prestigious post, 
which has great influence on the 
future of Columbia College. 

A fax came in from Mark 
Rantala recently, letting me know 
that after eight years at a big Ohio 
commercial real estate firm, he has 
left to start his own firm, Rantala 
& Co. He says he specializes in 
site acquisition, tenant representa¬ 
tion and shopping-center leasing 
for retail tenants in northeast 
Ohio. Mark and his wife Mary 
Anne (and their two daughters) 
spent a "wonderful summer 
watching the Indians make their 
first serious mn at the World 
Series since I was 3 (1954)." Only 
an entrepreneur could put it so 
gracefully. 

All of these businessmen might 
well make use of the services of 
Michael Silverman. After 16 
years of working as a commercial 
loan afficer for several of New 
York's largest commercial banks, 
Mike left to complete a master's 
degree in accounting. He has now 
joined the accounting firm of Perl 
and Asch in Purchase, N. Y., 
where he continues to help small 
and mid-sized commercial clients 
raise outside funds. 

I think that many of us consid¬ 
er the academic life as the ulti¬ 
mate in freedom. However, even 
few academics can match the 
wanderlust of Jon Kowallis. 
When I first heard from Jon, he 
was at the East-West Institute in 
Hawaii. I lost track of him for a 
few years, but later he had spent 
three years in mainland China 
before completing his Ph.D. at 
Berkeley in 1989. He is now 
teaching Chinese language and 


literature at Williams College, but 
has been on sabbatical teaching in 
Prague and now at the Center for 
Chinese Studies at U.C.-Berkeley. 

The only classmate who may 
have spanned the globe to more 
ports is Mark Carrabes. I recently 
got a terse note from Mark that 
said, "Retired from the Navy's 
Antarctic program as a Lieutenant 
Commander. Now living in Lyttel¬ 
ton, the port of Christ Church, 
New Zealand." I guess that no 
matter how free the spirit, once 
you spend enough time in Antarc¬ 
tica, it is time to return to the 
mainstream!

or extreme news to report on 
your family, career or interests,

Francis Jacobyanski, D.M.D., 
Normelville, Pa., the proud father 
of 16-month-old Michael, was 
recently accepted as a fellow in 
the Academy of General Den¬ 
tistry. "Life is wonderful," says 
Francis, who practices in a small 
town "where traffic is considered 
getting behind a logging truck, 
and where we still have a general 
store." He is practicing for the 
N.Y.C. Marathon "in a few 
years," and hopes to visit Colum¬ 
bia, hopefully for our 20th 
reunion. 

Jon Kushner, North Potomac, 
Md., came home from Walter 
Reed Army Medical Center to fin¬ 
ish the N.Y.C. Marathon in under 
five hours (4:59:41), "close to my 
old time from 'home to first.'" 
Now Francis up in Pennsylvania 
could use some coaching... 

That's all for this issue. 
Remember our 20th reunion is 
coming up. Be there if you can.

Media acquisitions can be said to 
have dominated the business 
news in 1995, and Kenin M. Spi- 
vak was part of that frenzied 
activity. Kenin serves as presi¬ 
dent of Archon Communications, 
a company formed to acquire 
and operate media companies, 
having previously served as chief 
operating officer of MGM/UA 
until its sale to Pathe. His present 


company is one of the nation's 
five largest radio networks and 
syndicated program suppliers, 
with dozens of syndicated pro¬ 
grams and more than 2,200 radio 
affiliates under contract to broad¬ 
cast programming. 

Another media-connected class 
member, Paul 1. Wolansky, 
describes himself as a writer/ 
teacher/artist-in-residence at Uni¬ 
versity of Southern California. The 
former psychology major received 
an Annenberg Grant to produce 
The Family Tree: A Personal Odyssey 
as a video documentary. 

On another coast. Dr. Barry G. 
Bergdoll was granted tenure as 
an Associate Professor of Art His¬ 
tory at Columbia. He recently 
published two scholarly books in 
his field. He is planning an exhibi¬ 
tion for the centennial of the 
Morningside campus at the Wal- 
lach Art Gallery for fall 1997. 

Other academics were heard 
from. Dr. Bart K. Holland, a 
research scientist and professor at 
New Jersey Medical School, has a 
book which will soon be in publi¬ 
cation, Evaluating Ancient and 
Medieval Medicines. Gary J. 
Galperin teaches at Benjamin N. 
Cardozo School of Law, and is 
chief of the Special Projects Bureau 
of the Manhattan district attor¬ 
ney's office, where one of his spe¬ 
cialties is forensic psychiatry. 

After ten years of big firm life, 
John D. Wall found happiness as 
chief assistant county attorney in 
Tampa, Ha. John met his wife, 
Kim, at a public hearing on a mall 
zoning; they were married in 1991. 

William F. Gray has lent us his 
Fifth Avenue offices for reunion 
planning meetings at Christy &

This is officially the last column 
I'll write while all of us are still 
thirty-something. I'm not sure 
what the significance of that is 
except that maybe we'll get 
together more in the coming year 
at each other's 40th-birthday par¬ 
ties. Or maybe we'll all have mid¬ 
life crises and the artists will go 
back to law school and the 
lawyers will all become film pro¬ 
ducers. Either way it should be 
good for the class-notes business, 
so I'm psyched. 

The best correspondent of all 
you guys has always been Tom 
Mariam, who sent works of art 
last spring that touched on many 


topics, from celebrating the 
Rangers' Stanley Cup victory in 
their dressing room after the sev¬ 
enth game (along with Jeff Klein 
'79) to going on a safari to Kenya 
and "realizing who is really king 
out there—is that why the Lions 
represent King's College? 

"I even got to eat crocodile and 
zebra—something they don't 
serve (I don't think) in John Jay 
cafeteria," Tom says. The big news 
from Tom is that he's left the 
Amex and joined Rubenstein 
Associates, the big public relations 
firm, as a vice president. Ruben¬ 
stein handles, among many 
clients, the Yankees. 

Moving from journalism to law 
is Hugh McGough, who recently 
graduated with honors and clerk¬ 
ships galore from the University 
of Pittsburgh School of Law and 
has now joined the top Steel City 
firm. 

Marty Cicco had a nice picture 
in the New York Times last year 
concerning his work for Merrill 
Lynch's real estate investment 
banking group. 

Tim Weiner, of WKCR and 
Pulitzer Prize fame, has a regular 
by-line on the front page of the 
Times, covering the complex world 
of the C.I.A. and related matters. 

If you need to sue someone in 
Queens, consider calling Paul 
Cutrone, who writes that he is 
starting his own firm in that bor¬ 
ough. Paul is married to Joyce 
Noulas B'78 and they have three 
children, William, Arthur, and 
Carolyn. 

My wife, Marian Chertow B'77, 
and our kids Elana, 5, and Joy, 1, 
are doing great, and New Haven 
is still a challenge to redevelop 
for me. 

Theme for 1996: Please send in 
your reflections on life, college 
and the future as you reach the 
venerable fourth decade.

Just a brief note from your class 
columnist. I have not heard from 
many of you so I will just have a 
few updates to report. 

We had our lOth-year reunion 
in June. Our attendance was good 
but we hope to have more at our 
next reunion in five short years. 

Seen at reunion were Mark Fal- 
lick and his wife Dana. They con¬ 
tinue to live in Boston as Mark fin¬ 
ishes his training. Andrew Lund 
is finishing film school and con¬ 
templating a career in cinema. 
Martin Friedman, attending 
reunion with his wife Suzanne 
Waltman '87, is now at J. P. Mor¬ 
gan. Howard Rappaport is work¬ 
ing at Phillips, Nizer. David Sloss- 
berg was in attendance with his 
wife and baby. Paul Bongiomo 
attended with his wife and said 
that he is working in the arts man¬ 
agement field. Paul Conomos is 
finishing his residency in Provi¬ 
dence and moving to Phoenix as 
a pulmonologist. 

Two members of our class are 
now representing the State of Ver¬ 
mont as assistant attorneys gener¬ 
al: Tim Tomasi and Ira Morris. 
Steve Dembitzer is practicing 
entertainment law at Grubman & 
Indursky. Dan Poliak is practic¬ 
ing intellectual property law in 
Seattle and represents the estate 
of Jimi Hendrix. Brian Margolis 
is at Weil, Gotshal & Manges. 
Andrew Hayes continues to prac¬ 
tice law in New York at Jones, 

Day, Reavis & Pogue. Harold Ull- 
man continues to work as a tax 
lawyer at Curtis Mallet. Gary 
Brown is an assistant U.S. attor¬ 
ney for the Eastern District of 
New York. 

Non-lawyers (there are a few) 
include Jim Lima, who is a direc¬ 
tor at the N.Y.C. Department of 
Housing, Preservation and Devel¬ 
opment; Kevin Kelly is a busi¬ 
ness consultant in Miami with a 
practice in South America, after 
working at American Express; 
Larry Riba is at Hewlett Packard 
in San Jose; Michael Cho (recent¬ 
ly married) is a management con¬ 
sultant based in Los Angeles; Jon 
White runs his family's coffee 
roasting and distribution business 
(he's bullish on the explosion in 
coffee sales); Tom Scotti is at Gor¬ 
don Brothers Finance Corp., a 
company specializing in secured 
lending to retailers; and more. 

Pace Cooper writes that he and 
his wife Aileen had twins, Dylan 
Jacob and Ethan Jonah. Pace con¬ 
tinues to work for his family's 


hotel group based in Memphis. 
Other classmates have reported 
impending births but—supersti¬ 
tious me—let's wait until we hear 
news of healthy births. 

Several people who were 
actively involved in organizing 
the reunion weekend were pre¬ 
sent. Paul Getzels, who now 
works for Gersten, Savage, 
Kaplowitz & Curtin as a litigation 
associate, sings with the City Bar 
Chorus and the Big Apple Chorus 
in a 90-man barbershop group 
(along with Tom Vinciguerra's 
brother Ray). Brian Cousins is at 
the New York office of Baker & 
McKenzie. Charlie Butler is the 
editor of Sales & Marketing Man¬ 
agement magazine. Paul, Charlie, 
Brian and I all received the Lion 
pin from the Dean of the College 
at the concluding reception. 

On my personal front, I contin¬ 
ue to work as an assistant coun¬ 
sel at the New York State Hous¬ 
ing Finance Agency and partici¬ 
pate in alumni events and other 
pro bono activities in New York. 

That is it for now. When I run 
into classmates they tell me they 
enjoy the column but want to 
hear about other people. I 
acknowledge that my circuit is 
somewhat limited; however, I am 
game and would love to hear 
from as many of you as possible. 
Best wishes.

It's scary I know, but our 10th 
reunion is just around the corner. 
Please mark your calendars for 
May 31 to June 2,1996. You 
should have received a reunion 
questionnaire by now, so please 
take five minutes and fill it out. 
We are determined to make this 
reunion a success (i.e., many 
more than the 20 people who 
showed up at our fifth). 

Hope you all enjoyed the sum¬ 
mer (is it just me or does summer 
seem to be getting shorter each 
year?). I know Kevin Toner has. 
He dropped out of the corporate 
rat race and spent the summer 
traveling across the U.S. I joined 
him for a week of hiking, biking, 
and fly fishing in spectacular Sun 
Valley, Idaho. 

I sleuthed the location of sever¬ 
al of you who had become "lost" 
to the alumni office. Howie 
Shams works in corporate law at 
Richard Spears Kibbe & Orbe in 
Manhattan and is married to Alis- 
sa Seawald. They have three chil¬ 
dren: Pamela, 5, Nathan, 3, and 
Rebecca, 1. Ben Feder tried to 
escape notice but was similarly 
tracked down. He's been quite 
busy since graduation: he studied

history at Oxford, worked at the 
World Bank, got his MBA at Har¬ 
vard, worked in strategic plan¬ 
ning at 20th Century Fox in L.A., 
and recently moved back to New 
York, where he is surfing in 
cyberspace as executive v.p. at 
Delphi, an internet provider. Ben 
is married to Vicky Lindenbaum 
and they're expecting their first 
child in December. 

Famed Columbia fencer Steve 
Trevor wrote to say that he and 
his wife Ronnie have moved to 
Hong Kong. Steve works at Gold¬ 
man Sachs there. Congrats to Dr. 
Michael Caldwell, health com¬ 
missioner of Dutchess County, 
who made the front page of The 
New York Times last July. He led a 
campaign to prevent Hyde Park 
from adopting as its official seal 
the famed silhouette of FDR with 
a cigarette holder clenched 
between his teeth. Lyme disease 
and E. coli outbreaks can wait, 
Mike, for key health issues like 
these (I'm just kidding!). Mike 
received his medical degree from 
Mount Sinai and a master's in 
public health from Harvard. He's 
on the board of the local chapters 
of Big Brothers/Big Sisters and the 
American Cancer Society. I'm sure 
Mike would be proud of David 
Rakoff, who wrote an op-ed piece 
in the Times. Rakoff, a former two- 
pack-a-day smoker, cheered the 
new smoldng ban in New York 
City. He's an in-house writer for a 
publisher in Manhattan.

In a world of corporate sponsor¬ 
ship gone amok, may I present to 
you—your class notes... spon¬ 
sored by Mickey's Malt Liquor... 

Actually, they're sponsored by 
Jill Levey, who in her capacity at 
Columbia's Alumni Affairs office, 
has typed up more extensive, and 
I might add, more grammatically 
correct tidbits about our class¬ 
mates. 

There's got to be a preposition 
dangling somewhere in there. See 
what I mean? 

Lawyers, lawyers everywhere... 

Hal Shapiro and Andy 
Hyman are lawyers in D.C., Hal 
with the Department of Justice 
and Andy with Health and 
Human Services. Dan Goldberg- 
er is with White and Case in New 
York. Jacob Goldberg is at Spec- 
tor & Roseman in Philly, where 


he's just welcomed a new son 
into the City of Brotherly Love. 
Alan Cooke and former Lion bas¬ 
ketball captain Doug Woods are 
lawyering in Boston, while Eileen 
McCarthy and Joyce Sun are 
doing likewise in N.Y.C. 

Reporting about lawyers is an 
occupational hazard of this job, Jill. 

Jonathan Lavine works at 
Bain Capital and lives in Need¬ 
ham, Mass, with his wife and 
one-year-old daughter, Jill 
reports. Also landing near Ply¬ 
mouth Rock is Willie Woo, with 
Advent International. 

Commitment is in the air for 
many other classmates as well, 
with new engagements and mar¬ 
riages popping up right and left. 
Engaged classmates include 
Giuliana Dunham, Jill Levey, 
and Claire Theobold (to Michael 
Purves '86). Just married are 
Matthew Cooper, Miriam 
Goderich, Spencer Harrington 
(to Susannah Bartlett, '88B), Sara 
Just, Susie Marples, and 
Suzanne Rothauser. 

Doing Hippocrates proud... 
our freshly minted doctors, Cor¬ 
nelia Gallo, Sameena Khan and 
Jonathan Rosand. Alicia Reiger 
(nee Stein) just started at Albert 
Einstein Medical College in the 
Bronx. 

And doing Spectator proud... 
alums Spencer Harrington at 
Archeology magazine, Sara Just at 
ABC News, and John Oswald, 
assistant managing editor at the 
Jersey Journal. 

Leslie Harris completed her 
history doctorate at Stanford and 
is now an assistant professor at 
Emory Univ. 

Samantha Pirkowski (nee 
Morton), one of our lovely cheer¬ 
leaders, recently wed—a Colum- 
bia-alum-studded event, she tells 
me. Samantha gave up the law 
and now works for Mary Kay 
Cosmetics. She was recently fea¬ 
tured in the April issue of Work¬ 
ing Woman. 

Jeremy Dickstein is a branch 
manager at Fidelity Investments. 
He too just got engaged. Jeremy 
boldly went where no man has 
gone before, onstage in Mexico, 
where he interrupted a show and 
proposed to Jill Aronson before 
hundreds of bemused and 
enchanted guests. 

Damn, Jill, you can dig up the 
dirt... 

Claire Theobald works as a 
graphic designer for Ralph 
Applebaum Associates. 

Judy Annozine is currently in 
Wayne State's grad acting pro¬ 
gram. 

Emily Paolinetti (nee Skopov) 
is in Hollywood, writing for the 
new TV show. The Client. She and 
her husband Jamie are the proud 
parents of two pit bulls. Emily's 



Eliza Armstrong '89 was greeted at Grade Mansion in August by New York 
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani as a representative of the city's summer intern¬ 
ship program. Ms. Armstrong, a second-year student at Columbia's School of 
International and Public Affairs (and daughter of Jack Armstrong '55), 
worked in the Child Welfare Division of the city's Office of Management and 
Budget. She says she aspires to a career in public finance, and to that end will 
probably enroll for an MBA at Columbia. She is married to Andrew McDade, 
who works in movie production; they live in Morningside Heights. Although 
she is happy to shake hands with Republicans, Ms. Armstrong maintains, "I 
am a registered independent. Always have been, always will be."

come a long way from the heat at 
Blair Academy when she was a 
manager for the Lion football 
team and was forced to duck 
from hurled water bottles. 

Not to out-Jill Jill, but I spoke 
to ex-Lion baseball captain John 
Stamatis and he promised me an 
update on the Columbia boys of 
summer. John is the deputy com¬ 
missioner of the NBA... ooops... I 
mean, director of licensing. He's 
very busy and our CU baseball 
will have to wait...more Stama- 
tis-bashing will follow as well. 

I began with Jill and I'll end 
with a bill. Because I'm already 
saving my money for—you 
guessed it—another Lion football 
wedding. This time Captain 
Mike Bissinger weds former 
Lion women's soccer great Kristin 
Eriedholm '90 in Cape Cod. And 
if the past is any indication. I'll 
need some help to pick up the 
pieces.

Today's column has been 
sponsored by the letter "T". I 
attempted to survey all members 
of our class whose last name 
starts with T—there are 31 of you. 
If you don't see your brief bio, 
that's because your number was 
disconnected, I don't make over¬ 
seas phone calls, or you recently 
have been mentioned in this col¬ 
umn. My hit rate was just under 
20 percent. If inclusive of recently 
summarized classmates, this ratio 
would have improved to a still 


unimpressive 30 percent. All other 
T's, get in touch with me and let 
me know you're okay. I care. 

Daniel Taubenblat just moved 
from Cambridge to Back Bay, 
Boston. Eli "the Neus" Neusner 
assisted him in the moving 
process. Daniel works for BIS 
Strategic Decisions, an informa¬ 
tion technology consulting group. 
Eli is a financial services consul¬ 
tant for Cerulli Associates. The 
Neus looks great, he's still play¬ 
ing rugby, and he spends a por¬ 
tion of his free time acting. Toula 
Tavalarides has been living a 
very glamorous and international 
lifestyle. She's currently with the 
Bank of New York in N.Y.C. 
doing trade finance. She earned 
two M.A.'s from Georgetown, in 
foreign service and economics, 
the evil science. While in school, 
she interned with the World Bank 
and USAID. She also had a stint 
in Jakarta sponsored by the Port 
Authority of NY/NJ. They gave 
her the choice of working in New 
Jersey or Indonesia. Go figure: 
she chose the latter. Max Terry's 
mother tells me he is working in 
Japan and has been there for a 
couple of years. Max is married 
and working for Young & Rubi- 
cam. Aitken Thompson is an 
attorney and attends to antitrust 
and securities litigation. He grad¬ 
uated from C.U. Law in '94 and 
married a law school classmate in 
September. Mazel tov! 

Congratulations are also in 
order to Shirley Tsang, who is an 
intern at Long Island Jewish Hos¬ 
pital and will intern at Albert Ein¬ 
stein next year. She spent two

years in research at Memorial 
Sloan-Kettering prior to med 
school. While we're on the subject 
of doctors (even though he's not 
a T), we must note that Gene 
Hong, too, is a physician. He had 
a fellowship in Connecticut, is 
back in Boston, and is engaged to 
be married next year. Though we 
have mentioned this T recently, 
we'll give Todd Thomason 
another plug. This toucan's bach¬ 
elor days are numbered. He will 
marry Allison Karmel, his Univ. 
of Chicago sweetheart, in Octo¬ 
ber. In time, we trust single 
women everywhere will find the 
strength to recover from this bit¬ 
tersweet news. 

As always, I love receiving 
mail from classmates. Mike 
dikes writes that he has been 
working in strategic planning for 
the E.P.A. in D.C. for the last 
three years. He received an M.A. 
in public administration from 
G.W. University. Angelo and 
Anne-Marie Wright Ninivaggi 
are the proud new parents of a 
beautiful baby girl, Anne Caro¬ 
line. Congratulations! Anne- 
Marie is on maternity leave from 
her job as deputy director of com¬ 
munications for the New York 
City Council, and Angelo is fin¬ 
ishing his first year as a corporate 
attorney. 

Lisa Landau and Liz Pleshette 
renewed their pledge (threat?) to 
get tattooed if the Lions win the 
Ivy football crown. Motif and 
body surface details have yet to 
be announced, but the event will 
be public, Liz vows. CCT has 
already promised coverage. 

I am currently accepting sug¬ 
gestions for future column spon¬ 
sorships. I may be reached by all 
major forms of communications— 
mail, phone (603-643-9227), fax, 
and e-mail (amy.h.perkel@dart- 
mouth.edu). I have nothing 
against face-to-face communica¬ 
tion, either. If in Hanover, do drop 
in. Amy Hope.

Note the new address above. Yes, 
another major life change. Any¬ 
way, let's get to it. 

First up, Rick Minnich writes 
that he spent the summer at 
Schloss Wiepersdorf—a writer's 
colony in a castle just south of 
Berlin—where he will write his 
next film script. His short films 
have played in 12 countries in 
North America, Europe, Africa 
and Australia. 

Next, Amy Glasser (formerly 
Liebowitz) reports that she mar¬ 
ried her husband Steve in 1992 
and they live in Washington, D.C. 
Last May, Amy received her 
Ph.D. in clinical psychology from 
American University. 

Finally, David Gratt maintains 
that he was working as a bouncer 
at one of the sleazy strip clubs on 
Iberville Street in the French Quar¬ 
ter. Now, he insists, he is undergo¬ 
ing rehab for heroin addiction. 

(My repetition of Dave's claims, 
strange as they may be, shows 
that I will stop at nothing to satis¬ 
fy my several readers. Dave, are 
you happy that I've compromised 
my psuedo-joumalistic integrity at 
your whim?) 

Certainly more than three peo¬ 
ple in our class have minimally 
interesting lives, but submissons 
have declined. Increase produc¬ 
tion or I'll begin massive layoffs. 

We'II have lots of news, includ¬ 
ing notes from the 5th reunion, 
next time.

The information superhighway 
sucks. 

For those of you who decided 
to take me up on my word and e- 
mail me your really great gossip 
about your life and your wonder¬ 


ful friends, I have some bad news: 
I drove a Pinto on this brave new 
road and your mail is forever lost. 
Yes, that means everyone—even 
Rhodes Scholar Carl Marci (who 
was nice enough to send me some 
e-mail about how he is in med 
school)—was screwed by me 
when I "downloaded" your infor¬ 
mation into a black hole that 
swirls about on my dirt-encrusted 
hard drive. Please don't despair; 
write me again using what 
compu-nerds call "snail-mail." If 
only this were "SEAS Today" this 
never would have happened. Hal 
must be proud.... 

Onward to a pile of mail that is 
mixed in with a musty bunch of 
bills that, like this column, are 
appropriately labeled "past 
due"... Lt. Michael Leiter wrote a 
letter that arrived in the home 
office in Slingerlands just today. 
The good lieutenant writes that 
Chris Front is leaving his job as 
textbook editor in Chicago and 
entering the Ph.D. program in 
American history at Northwest¬ 
ern. Also according to Lt. Leiter: 
Greg Ostling had fun working in 
Taiwan and as a paralegal in 
Manhattan but decided to have 
more fun by going to law school 
at Northwestern. Caroline Cheng 
is working as an associate at a 
large law firm in the Chicago area 
as well. Lt. Leiter is currently sta¬ 
tioned at a Naval air base outside 
of Seattle where he flies aircraft 
carrier-based attack jets. He also 
was aboard the U.S.S. George 
Washington, which for a while 
was floating precariously near the 
Bosnia Herzegovinian neck of the 
global woods. At least someone 
in our class is keeping the world 
safe for democracy while the rest 
of us watch Melrose Place ... 
Phillip Rodgers sent CCT a nice 
note saying that he was about to 
graduate from the Medical Center 
of Ohio in Toledo and start his 
residency at the University of 
Michigan. Phillip writes: "But 
perhaps more frightening than 
my soon-to-be-acquired ability to 
dispense drugs legally is the fact 
that I'm being permitted to cross 
state lines." One can only hope 
that Phillip will be handling the 
festivities at the fifth-year reunion 
which will take place on campus 
May 31-June 2. 

I have a very old letter from 
Susie Wood sent from Turk¬ 
menistan that has some good 
news, some of which probably still 
is true. Susie writes that Ingrid 
Stabb is working for a new com¬ 
puter company in Palo Alto, CaUf. 
Matt Freedman is working at Pub¬ 
lic Citizen in Washington, D.C. 
while Marcelene Hearn is in D.C. 
working at the Urban Institute. 

The last I heard from Susie, she 
was working as a Peace Corps vol-

unteer in Turkmenistan with Jen- 
rufer Sandman '93. God only 
knows if they are still 
there... Heather E. G. Brownlie 
wrote a very concerned letter 
about why there was no column 
last issue (money. Heather, it's all 
about getting paid) but also 
informs me that she is now the 
charter manager for the Hampton 
Jitney. Heather E.G. graduated 
from New York Law School in 
June 1994 and passed the bar in 
New York and New Jersey. Now 
about that free jitney. Heather... 
Alicia Schmidt-Camacho, former 
campus firebrand and aU-around 
good person, got married to 
Stephen Pitti on August 13,1994 in 
Sacramento, according to an 
annoimcement that was mailed 
my way. No other information was 
provided about the nuptials in El 
Santuario Nacional de Nuestra 
Senora... Warren St. John seems to 
write about one "Talk of the 
Town" item m the New Yorker each 
week. And, even more impressive¬ 
ly, he accomplishes this feat with¬ 
out even being British.. .John 
Griffin was just promoted to a 
full-blown producer on the Biogra¬ 
phy series on A&E... Marc Eisen- 
berg graduated from P&S this past 
May along with Jane Chew, 
Stephen Fealy, Linda Martin, and 
John Poneros. I feel better 
already... I ran into Tamara Straus 
as she was leaving a yoga class 
and looking imposingly fit... Bob 
Kolker, former power-editor of the 
impressive flashy weekly arts sec¬ 
tion at the Spectator, is an editor at 
the brand new flashy weekly Time 
Out New York ... Finally, Liz Woll- 
man answered my pathetic cry of 
"Andy Dunn, where are you?" 
from a few issues back. "I know 
where he is!" Liz writes. "At the 
moment, sitting on the couch 
watching Law and Order with me." 
Oh well. Liz tells me that Andy is 
writing and acting as well as 
improvising and teaching for 
Gotham City Improv in New York. 
Liz is a grad student at City Uni¬ 
versity and working on her doctor¬ 
ate in ethnomusicology. At least 
two decent hard-working people 
sound quite happy together... I 
apologize for the brevity of this 
installment. The next episode will 
be longer and end on a scary 
cliffhanger. Send me mail telling 
me why the fifth-year reunion this 
coming spring is worth attending 
and maybe you'll see me there. If 
not, send a SASE and get an auto¬ 
graphed photo. Cheers.

wish for. I was all set to make the 
usual calls to check and see what 
news I could dig up on my class¬ 
mates and run in this column. 

Imagine my surprise when I 
received two large envelopes full 
of material from Candice Work¬ 
man in the development office 
full of completed surveys that 
you folks sent in for our Reunion. 
In addition to the information in 
a few letters that I received. I'll 
do my best to fit all the informa¬ 
tion I got into my next couple of 
columns. And thank you. Can- 
dice, for making my life easy. 

Charles Dimitroff writes that 
he is in the middle of completing 
a Ph.D. in molecular pharmacolo¬ 
gy and cancer therapeutics at 
SUNY Buffalo's Roswell Park 
Graduate School. Anna Ham is a 
second-year medical student at 
Nova Southeastern University. 
Dean Hecker is a second-year 
law student at Stanford. Ashish 
Jha reports completing a year of 
research and moving on to his 
clinical rotations at Harvard Med¬ 
ical School. Maihgan Kavanagh 
just received her M.P.H. (master 
of public health) from Johns Hop¬ 
kins, and is returning to UCLA to 
complete medical school. Lucea 
Suzan Kedron recently left a 
position at an architectural firm 
to pursue a law degree at South 
Texas College of Law. 

Jill Tapley Stevenson has been 
busy working on her master's 
degree in fisheries biology. She 
reports having spent much time 
on the Hudson River near Pough¬ 
keepsie collecting sturgeon for 
her thesis. 

Laura Lopez writes that hav¬ 
ing graduated from NYU Law 
School, she will be clerking for 
the Hon. Judge Duh'e on the Fifth 
Circuit in Lafayette, La. She 
would love to hear from any 
members of our class in that area. 

April Arlt married Robert Haga 
'92E on May 29,1994 in St. Paul's 
Chapel. Chris Minnetian was in 
the wedding party. The Rev. Scott 
Matheney of Earl Hall presided. 
April will be leaving her beloved 
home of three years, San Francis¬ 
co, to begin a doctoral program in 
political science at the University 
of Wisconsin at Madison. 

Debbie Kessler writes that she 
spent two years living in San 
Antonio and "finding Northern¬ 
ers among the cowboys to keep 
me sane." She is now back in 
New York. 

Double congratulations are in 
order for Elizabeth Santiago. She 
married David Weinstock, and on 
July 6, gave birth to Sophia 
Gabrielle Weinstock. 

Tami Luhby is a reporter for 
the Home News in New Jersey and 
is freelancing for Newsday. 

Finally, there is news from 


Robert Kim. He received an M.A. 
from Johns Hopkins School of 
Advanced International Studies. 
While in the program he spent a 
summer in Moscow working 
with the State Department. He 
now resides in the Washington, 
D.C. area and is working for the 
Department of Defense. 

Well, as you read this. I'll proba¬ 
bly be poring over an obscure legal 
text (or worse) in my law firm's 
library. I've moved recently— 
please note the new address when 
you keep those letters coming. 
We're getting close to our fifth-year 
reunion. I look forward to seeing 
and hearing from aU of you in the 
time between then and now.

After a working trek to the Philip¬ 
pines—a breathtaking land span¬ 
ning some 7,100 islands—^I 
returned to this other fine island 
and to a pile of news from excel¬ 
lent adventurers. In a letter from 
the former track captain, Matthew 
Henry, I learned that after much 
searching and suffering during a 
stint as an assistant in a small 
SoHo publishing firm, Matthew 
has run off to his next exciting 
arena—the deep, enigmatic recess¬ 
es of the athletic psyche. He 
recently began a two-year clinical 
psychology program in San Fran¬ 
cisco, where he hopes to master 
the science of counseling jocks— 
which is good, because I can think 
of a few NBA players on a certain 
San Antonio team in need of a 
serious attitude adjustment. 

Proud father James Levy '65 
mailed in a clipping of the May 
edition of Forbes in which son 
Daniel is featured among enter¬ 
prising Generation X-ers, a term I 
personally feel has lost its je ne 
sais quoi. In any case, Daniel, a for¬ 
mer interactive software designer 
for AT&T, garnered the support of 
New York developers with an 
idea to revolutionize real-estate 
classifieds on the Internet. The 
company, of which Daniel holds 
50 percent and is chief executive,

Seth Rockman e-mailed me 
from U.C.-Davis, where he was 
getting set to take his Ph.D. quali- 
f 3 dng exams in U.S. history, to tell 
me that David Shayne, who 
delighted Spec editorial meetings 
with his unique version of stupid 
human tricks, has taken his won¬ 
derfully twisted wit to the pages of 


Mad magazine, where his panel on 
designer personal checks graced 
the back cover. "Instead of the 
usual fare of kittens and flowers," 
wrote Seth, "Dave featured skin 
diseases and totalitarian dictators." 

That said, I encourage all of you 
to run to your mailbox and fill 
those contribution envelopes to 
your College Fund. A mind, you 
know, is a terrible thing to waste. 

Seth also wrote that Jon 
Bernard Schwartz, one of the 
founding members of the Electric 
Company featured in the last 
issue of CCT, is living in Austin, 
Texas and hookin' em in his sec¬ 
ond year of law school at U.T He 
and Angela Leon-Guerrero will 
be getting married next May. The 
Peace Corps, Seth reports, took 
Kate Zoph to Morocco, and 
Thomas Hilbink left his position 
as assistant to the president of the 
ACLU to start law school at 
N.Y.U. Tom researched much of 
Nadine Strossen's recent book on 
pornography, and was honored 
this year by the New York Taxi 
and Limousine Commission for 
taking on racist cabbies and 
exposing discriminatory pick-up 
practices. Now if he would only 
do something about the horn- 
happy street mongers who terror¬ 
ize my neighborhood, this would 
be a perfect world. 

To catch up on some of the gen¬ 
erous reporting contributions by 
Romsai Boonyasai and Angela

about to finish his first year of 
architecture school at Princeton

soon. Yukiko Ueno is "working 
with yeast" in her first year at an 
M.I.T. Ph.D. program. Pavani 
Kalluri is a first-year at Mount 
Sinai Medical School. Marcia 
Wongchirachai is working at 
Coopers & Lybrand and Joe Lasz- 
lo, who is at Tufts' Fletcher School 
getting his master's, wants 
Madonna fans to catch his e-mail 
on the World Wide Web. Angela's 
pal, Alan Swarts, is working at a 
Japanese TV production company 
in the East Village, and was 
recently sent to Tokyo the day 
before the subways were poisoned 
with sarin. Fortunately, Angela 
received a call from Alan report¬

up with cartoonist Augie Tam '91, 
who moved to Tokyo in January. 

I see that ASIlers are still trav¬

CLASS NOTES 


Columbia College Today 


So what do you do with 
a B.A. in philosophy? 

H it the road in a Winnebago, naturally. Eventually, Allison 
Jones '95 wants to be a doctor. But for the moment, she is 
reveling in her exposure as a cast member of Road Rules, an 
MTV series that presents a "fly-on-the-wall perspective," 
as Time magazine calls it, of the life of college-age kids. 

Road Rules debuted in July in the wake of the enormously popular 
MTV documentary The Real World and its various spin-offs, which 
portrayed twenty-something strangers living in Manhattan, California 
and London. In her series, Ms. Jones (always clad in a Columbia hat or 
sweatshirt) travels across America in a Winnebago with five other 
road warriors to engage in specific—and offbeat—hijinks. MTV 
assigned them such tasks as winning a key to a city in Arizona, train¬ 
ing with the Marine Corps in Quantico, Va., land-sailing in New Mexi¬ 
co, working on an alligator farm in Louisiana, and performing as 
clowns in the circus. 

Ms. Jones is a veteran runner and member of the New York City 
Road Runners Club. But even the stamina that comes with that sort of 
resume didn't prepare her for some of her more rugged adventures. 
"We did so many things that I'd never do—like skydiving!" 

While the "job" of cross-country adventuress might appear to be 
exciting—nay, glamorous —viewers tend to forget that every gesture, 
every habit, every conversation, can be overheard by any dork who 
happens to be tuned to MTV. And the Winnebago itself was no isola¬ 
tion booth. "At one time, there could be as many as 15 people with us 
helping to produce the show," says Ms. Jones. 

The Huntington, Long Island native finished her 10 weeks of film¬ 
ing on the series last spring and now works as a lab technician while 
applying to medical school. As part of her recompense, she has been 
rewarded with a vacation to Europe—including accommodations in a 
few five-star hotels, rather than the Winnebago. 

Ms. Jones owes it aU to alma mater: "I found the advertisement posted 
on a wall last year in Philosophy Hall when I was running late to a class."

a bit of information about our 
class. I'd really appreciate any 
news, so please write, even just a 
few lines, and let us know what 
you're up to these days. 

While still in Berlin I received a 
faxed copy of a June article from 
the Los Angeles Times about Rachel 
Dewoskin, who seems to have 
found television fame in China. 
Apparently, Rachel was one of 
eight foreigners starring in a pop¬ 


ular Chinese show called "Foreign 
Gals in Beijing." She was playing 
Jesse, a spoiled wealthy American 
student, but said in the article that 
the fictional plot has had few simi¬ 
larities with her own experiences 
as an American in China. Also on 
the acting front, numerous people 
have told me that Jean Kelly 
plays a sweetly smirking AT&T- 
bashing telephone operator in an 
MCI commercial. 


During my stay in New York, I 
went to a party Mary Killackey 
(2nd-year at P&S) was having, 
and saw Steve Ruddy and Katy 
Negrin there. Katy said she's still 
working at the New School but is 
considering the possibility of law 
school in her future. She told me 
Alex Rosenstein is in his first 
year at Georgetown Law, and Jon 
Katz has also started law school 
at Boston University. She also 
said Robert-Paul Sagner is plan¬ 
ning to move out to Palo Alto, 
Calif, with Nadya Birnholz '93. 

A few days later, I saw Eliza¬ 
beth Berke, who has been pro¬ 
moted at Sanford C. Bernstein in 
New York City and is now 
responsible for their desktop pub¬ 
lishing. She told me Elliot Regen- 
stein is doing well at the Parks 
Commission in New York City 
and now has his own staff. 

Danny Franklin said that recent¬ 
ly on the street in Washington, 
D.C., he ran into Imara Jones, 
who said he was looking for a 
job. I also talked with Marina 
Gurin, who is still working for 
the J. Crew catalogue in New 
York. She said she wants to get 
more involved in fashion, but is 
toying with the idea of eventually 
returning to school. She said she 
had run into Sanjiv Jhaveri on 
the Upper West Side, who said he 
was still enjoying acting school. 

A quick glance at our high 
school's alumni magazine told 
me that Shawn Victor is working 
for Teach for America, teaching 
eighth-grade special education in 
Shreveport, La. Kay Bailey is still 
working as a legal secretary in 
Mexico City, but plans to head for 
Brazil next year to learn Por¬ 
tuguese and travel along the 
Amazon. Ayanna Parish has left 
England and is at Harvard in her 
first year of the English Ph.D. 
program there. Ben Strong has 
left New York and has also start¬ 
ed graduate school in English at 
U.C.-Santa Barbara. He told me 
Josh Shannon loves his work at 
the Alliance for the Arts, a not- 
for-profit institution that pro¬ 
motes cultural events in New 
York City. 

So that's how the world looks 
for the Class of 1994.1 hope you 
are all well and I look forward to 
hearing more from you soon.

In case you haven't watched MTV 
recently, you might have missed 
Allison Jones on The Road Rules , 
the new Real Wor/d-inspired show 
documenting the lives of twenty- 
somethings. With a handful of 


other road warriors, she travels 
around America in a Winnebago. 
In one episode, she used her 
excellent Columbia skills to locate 
the youngest mayor in the coun¬ 
try and win the key to a city in 
Arizona. You can catch Allison, 
who will begin medical school 
this fall at Stony Brook, in a 
Columbia sweatshirt and hat on 
Monday nights on MTV. 

I ran into Demetre Daskalakis 
this summer in Oxford, England, 
where he worked as an assistant 
dean at a summer program for 
high school students. He led me 
on a long search for a pub called 
the Perch through fields, gnat 
swarms, and across rivers to eat a 
fried-shrimp dinner. Demetre, 
who will also begin med school— 
at N.Y.U.—has been in contact 
with Needhi Bhalla: she begins a 
graduate program in biology at 
U.C.-San Francisco this fall. Anna 
Bidwell will work in Manhattan 
as a paralegal this year before 
going to law school, according to 
Demetre. 

Also around the New York 
area, Elise Feldman writes that 
she is working at the ACLU as 
the assistant to the president, 
Nadine Strossen. Dan Cooper, 
Sebastian Seiguer and John 
Collins are starting Columbia 
Law School and Ross Gotler will 
begin graduate work in medieval 
studies. Stephanie Schwartz is 
living in the Morningside Heights 
area and working at the Interna¬ 
tional Center of Photography, and 
Alex Mummery is working for a 
small publishing company in 
Manhattan. Greg Mancini and 
Kim Harrison started work for 
Andersen Consulting, and Jen 
Ross will perform medical 
research for one year before 
applying to medical school. 

In other news, Chris Fry, who 
ran with the bulls this summer in 
Pamplona, Spain, will travel to 
India and Pakistan for the next 
few months. Suzanne Dieter is 
packing to move to Cambridge, 
England, to begin her two years of 
study as a Kellett fellow. Finally, 
there seems to be a sizable num¬ 
ber of us going to graduate school 
next year in schools away from 
Columbia: Emily Juda will move 
to Atlanta to begin Emory Law 
and Saara Bickley will move to 
New Haven to study at Yale. Ryan 
Poscablo will begin at Harvard's 
Kennedy School of Government.

of war atrocities. I can also recall scenes 
of American servicemen whose bodies 
were mutilated and savaged in the 
fields and paddies where they had been 
killed. And 1 do not believe that Ms. 
Fonda visited Ho Chi Minh City 
(Saigon) in 1973 or at any other time. 
Even she probably had enough fore¬ 
sight not to have attempted that. 

The author claims to have been espe¬ 
cially moved by the sight of an American 
uniform (the likes of which he never 
wore) and an apology letter in a war 
museum. 1 no longer have any uniform 
items from Vietnam, but 1 do still have 
my l.D. tags and some other artifacts. 1 
do not sit around thinking about the war 
nor do 1 have to be concerned about con¬ 
trolling tears. We were not wrong, and 1 
am not sorry. 1 do not remember hearing 
any bells pealing in May 1975, but I can 
remember hearing "Taps" being played 
at memorial services held at our battal¬ 
ion compound many times during 1966. 

1 would like to think that a great 
many Columbia men who came of age 
during the war fought in it and not 
against it. It was very real to us then and 
the reality of the situation today contin¬ 
ues to draw mixed emotions. Mr. Argen- 
ti plans return visits to Vietnam and 1 
believe 1 would welcome the chance to 
do the same. Even a flight to Hanoi 
would be enjoyable, especially if it could 
be taken in the cockpit of a B-52 bomber.

Unheralded contribution 

CCT's recent article on the Manhattan 
Project ["The Race to Get the Bomb," 
Spring/Summer 1995] was of particular 
interest to me because I devised the 
most efficient process for the separation 
of the uranium isotopes while working 
at Columbia as an independent student 
investigator. 

On March 18,1940 1 was blinded in a 
chemical explosion at a Union Carbide 
laboratory in Niagara Ealls. While recu¬ 
perating at the Eye Institute of the 
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, 

1 heard an account on the radio of Pro¬ 
fessor John Dunning's demonstration 
that the fissioning of the uranium-235 
isotope produced sufficient neutrons to 
sustain a chain reaction. 1 was immedi¬ 
ately intrigued by the implications of 
this result, both for the generation of 


abundant electric power and for its 
potential as a military weapon that 
might well prove decisive in the war. 
Upon being released from the hospital 
in April 1940,1 looked up Professor 
Dunning and asked if I might work on 
an atomic energy problem while contin¬ 
uing my convalescence. He told me that 
the most important remaining problem' 
was to develop a process for the effi¬ 
cient separation of the uranium isotopes 
on an industrial scale. 1 graduated as a 
chemical engineer from Columbia in 
1934, and had since been engaged in 
process development research for the 
Carbide and Carbon Chemicals Compa¬ 
ny, a division of Union Carbide that 
was then pioneering the petrochemical 
industry in the United States. 

1 resolved to address the uranium 
isotope separation problem, and started 
to study the pertinent literature in the 
Physics Library with the help of a 
young M.l.T. student who served as my 
reader during his summer vacation. By 
the end of August, 1 had determined 
that the most energy-efficient process 
for producing a concentrated form of 
the fissionable uranium isotope was to 
employ a multiple-effect centrifugation 
cascade to process gaseous uranium 
hexafluoride. I wrote a paper describing 
the proposed process and designed a 
supercentrifugation cascade to carry it 
out. When 1 showed this paper to Pro¬ 
fessor Dunning, he recommended that 1 
pass my paper on to Professor Harold 
C. Urey, who had interested himself in 
the uranium isotope separation prob¬ 
lem; this 1 did on September 15, 1940. 

Dr. Urey evinced considerable inter¬ 
est in my recommendations and 
expressed surprise that 1 had done this 
work as an independent student inves¬ 
tigator. He asked me to make a formal 
presentation to the research staff he had 
assembled to work on the isotope 
enrichment problem under sponsorship 
of the United States Navy. 1 did so, and 
was hopeful that Urey would invite me 
to join his team for further work on a 
problem of great significance to the war 
effort. When 1 broached this possibility. 
Professor Urey said that he could not 
take responsibility for having a blind 
man work on so demanding an experi¬ 
mental investigation. However, 1 had 
gained the impression from some of his 
questioning that he considered me a 
potential security risk because of my 
German birth; 1 had emigrated to the 
United States in 1924 at the age of 12. 

1 was severely disappointed, filed a

patent application covering the centrifu¬ 
gation cascade with particular reference 
to the separation of the uranium isotopes, 
and tendered my patent application to the 
Secretary of the Navy. This application 
was immediately placed under secrecy, 
and a patent subsequently issued. 

Although the centrifugation process 
requires only four percent as much 
energy as the gaseous diffusion process, 
I recognized that the decision to employ 
gaseous diffusion for the war effort was 
justified because the centrifugation 
approach required the time-consuming 
development of a supercentrifuge, 
whereas the gaseous diffusion process 
could be implemented with readily 
available industrial equipment and the 
development of the critical barrier was 
far advanced. 

Having been denied a place on the 
Manhattan District Project, I stayed at 
Columbia to take a Ph.D. in chemical 
engineering under Professor Tom Drew. 
I subsequently returned to Union Car¬ 
bide, where I was given responsibility 
for the technical direction of a 500-man 
R&D organization. 

In 1946 the Congress passed an act to 
provide compensation for contributors 
to the atomic energy program under 
wartime secrecy. I knew that the gov¬ 
ernment had done some further devel¬ 
opment work on the centrifugation 
process, and I applied for an award. In 
1950, after hearings, the Patent Com¬ 
pensation Board acknowledged the 
seminal character of my invention but 
denied an award on the ground that 
the Government had not actually used 
my process. However, in 1977, Presi¬ 
dent Carter ordered the construction of 
a uranium enrichment plant employing 
the centrifugation cascade at a cost of 
$8 billion. I thereupon renewed my 
application for an award, and suggest¬ 
ed a royalty of one-half of one percent 
of the cost of the first plant. The Patent 
Compensation Board of the Depart¬ 
ment of Energy again conducted adver¬ 
sarial hearings and in 1984 concluded 
that I was the original inventor, 44 
years earlier, of the centrifugation cas¬ 
cade for the separation of the uranium 
isotopes. 

That is the good news; the bad news 
is that instead of granting the requested 
royalty, the board awarded me a prize 
of $100,000.1 have been told that this 
was one of the largest awards made 
under the compensation program, but I 
take more satisfaction from the official 
acknowledgment of my invention. The 


process has since been widely practiced 
in Europe. 

I thought your readers might be 
interested in this unheralded Columbia 
contribution.

Roman breakthrough 

Thairk you for the great article by Lau¬ 
rence Lippsett on the Manhattan Project. 

I recall seeing a plaque in the Insti¬ 
tute of Radiology of the University of 
Rome, where I was a medical student 
from 1963 to 1970. The plaque attested 
to the first-ever successful experiment 
in atomic fission by Enrico Fermi and 
his group in the physics institute on the 
Via Panisperna in Rome. As Richard 
Rhodes notes in The Making of the Atom¬ 
ic Bomb, this group was known as 
Corbino's boys, after the Sicilian sena¬ 
tor and physicist, Orso Mario Corbino, 
who was director of the physics insti¬ 
tute. This influential patron provided 
political support, making possible the 
government financial support that was 
needed for research. 

Apparently, if the plaque is correct, 
this experiment in atomic fission, or 
atom splitting, took place in Rome 
before Nobel laureate Fermi arrived at 
Columbia in 1939. The article in CCT 
refers to a discussion Enrico Fermi had 
with John R. Dunning which led to the 
splitting of the atom in the basement of

Xhe long tradition of Columbia men’s 
basketball has always relied upon the 
commitment and sacrifice of its 
student-athletes. Today, the demands 
placed on our athletes are just as tough 
yet still rewarding. 

The true experience of the student- 
athlete is barely surviving in the world 
of big-time college sports. In an arena 
where college athletes are being 
exploited for commercial gains and the 
university coffers are being filled, our 
athletes continue to uphold the high 
academic standards of the university 
and compete with some of the top 
teams in the country. It’s rewarding to 
know that Columbia student-athletes, 
win or lose, are still provided with the 
experience that enriches their 
education. 


The task of putting a competitive 
squad on the court that can play with 
the major programs in the country gets 
tougher and tougher every year. The 
Friends of Columbia Men’s Basketball 
exist to make this task just a bit 
less difficult. 

Each year the Friends provide 
support for expenses that are not 
funded by the athletic department. 
Scouting reports. Game films. Meals 
for the team during holidays. 

With the new season approaching 
and with the new head coach, 

Armond Hill, we invite you to support 
Columbia men’s basketball, its 
illustrious tradition and its student- 
athletes by completing the accom¬ 
panying form and sending your

The news item on computerized chem¬

with this statement: "Columbia chemistry 
professors are looking forward to the day 
when their students rarely crack a book." 

Compare that comment with this

text books as the principal medium of 
teaching will be as obsolete as the horse

Beyond received wisdom 

The tribute to Mark Van Doren in your 
Winter 1995 issue was outstanding. It 
really helped bring him back to those of 
us who had the honor of studying with 
him. For me, the essence of his great¬ 
ness was that he gave a student not the 
gift of Mark Van Doren but the gift of 
the student's own self. 

I'll clarify that last sentence: I had 
come from a Jesuit prep school where I 
had been a rather good student. Only in 
retrospect do I realize that much of this 
success was due to a good memory and 
an ability to paraphrase the received 
opinions handed down by our instruc¬ 
tors or found in our textbooks. That was 
all right as far as it went, but we did not 
have the courage of our own convictions 
to guide us when we chose to sail some 
alien sea of thought. Revealed wisdom 
was the guide, and if you came upon an 
area where it had not revealed itself, you 
felt very lost. 

Then came Columbia and Mark Van 
Doren. In his "Verse" class I sat at his 
feet, waiting for him to reveal what was 
good and what wasn't. But he didn't. Oh, 
he had strong opinions about what was 
good and what wasn't, but he wasn't 
there to tell us what was in his mind; he 
was there to help us articulate what was 
in ours. 

At first, I felt disappointed. After all, 
who cared about what we thought when 
a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet was in the 
room? We might spend half a period dis¬ 
cussing what some guy in the next row 
thought about a line of Wordsworth. My 
first reaction was, "Okay, okay, now let's 
get on with it. Let's hear the truth. Let's 
hear what he thinks." 

Then it began to dawn on me that 
what he was teaching us was something 
far more liberating: that our truth was 
just that— our truth, a truth valid for us, 
and not necessarily valid for the next 
person. Oh, how he was impatient with 
the person who just mouthed an opin¬ 
ion off the top of his head with no back¬ 
ground to support it! However, when 
one had done one's "homework," when 
one had exposed oneself in some depth 
to the field in question—oh, how he 
respected one's opinion then! 

What freedom! What responsibility! 
What a teacher! He gave you a tool you 
could—and had better—carry with you 
wherever you went: your own mind, 
your own thought. It was the most dis¬ 
orienting and liberating intellectual 
experience I ever had. 

Some years after graduating, I had 














LETTERS TO THE EDITOR/RHODES SCHOLARS

occasion to chat with Van Doren's 
younger brother, Paul (who bore a 
striking resemblance to Mark, even to 
the timbre of his voice). At one point I 
spoke in some detail of how much his 
brother had meant to me. Paul urged 
me to write to his brother, for he was 
sure Mark would enjoy hearing such 
sentiments from a former student. 

"Busyness," shyness, whatever the 
cause, the letter never got written— 
until today.

The creative mind revealed 

After my first class with Mark Van 
Doren in Humanities in 1946,1 went on 
to take his "Shakespeare" and "The 
Narrative Art," the latter a new course 
that he said he was creating as he went 
along. As John Hollander '50 remem¬ 
bered Homer, Dante, Cervantes and 
Kafka from that class, so 1 remember the 
Book of Job and Moby Dick. 

Of the hundred or more teachers I 
had during my school years, Mark Van 
Doren had the most unforgettable and 
profoundly positive impact on my life. 
To be in his class was to see—in a kind

walk in and apply for this." Mr. Menaker 
was told, "Forget it in New York," by 
way of being encouraged to apply 
through his home state of Virginia. Mr. 
Rudman said, "The only advice I got 
was, 'Don't spill your drink.'" 

Dick Menaker and other Scholars 
think the selection committees, at least 
in the past, may also have frowned on 
Columbia students, whose rebel image 
was only enhanced by the campus 
unrest in '68. "The general perception 
was that [the selection committees] just 
don't give it to Columbia people, that 
they were biased against Columbia, 
and thought that Columbia just didn't 
produce students suitable for the 
Rhodes," says Mr. Gruen. 

Some believe that Columbia's rep 
was further tainted when 1974 recipient 
Jeff Laurence '72 deferred the scholar¬ 
ship in favor of a Luce Fellowship to 
work in cancer research in Japan. But 
Mr. Laurence was actually enrolled at 
the University of Chicago Medical 
School at the time. (He has since

Tunics and eunuchs 

As a co-author of Saints Alive, the 1942 
Varsity Show, I was delighted to see the 
nostalgic memories it evoked in two of 
the letters which you printed in the 
Spring/Summer 1995 issue. For four long 
years my brilliant classmate, I. A. L. Dia¬ 
mond, wrote the book and lyrics for each 
show and, try as I could to get my scripts 
accepted, all I managed to do was to get 
bit parts in Iz's sharply satirical produc¬ 
tions (e.g. a tobacco auctioneer a la Lucky 
Strike commercials, a frenzied press box 
reporter reacting to a football game). 

At last, when Iz headed for Holly¬ 
wood and fame as Billy Wilder's collab¬ 
orator (Some Like It Hot, the Oscar-win¬ 
ning The Apartment et al.), my chance 
came. While in graduate school I 
teamed up with Bob Bergemann '44 and 
we submitted a script. At the same time, 
Ed Falasca '43 turned in an entry called 
Saints Alive. The selection committee 
liked his plot but preferred our dia¬ 
logue, and invited us to work together 


become associate professor of medicine 
at Cornell Medical Center and is co¬ 
author of the French paper that first 
disclosed the AIDS virus.) Whatever 
the reason, there followed a full decade 
of rejection for Columbia applicants. 

The track record has improved some¬ 
what since 1984, when Messrs. Long 
and Stephanopoulos joined Sir Cecil's 
exclusive club. Around that time, too, 
Blake Thurman, an assistant dean of 
students at Columbia from 1984 to 1991, 
undertook what he cheerfully calls his 
"obsession" with cultivating promising 
sophomores for major national scholar¬ 
ships, the Rhodes among them. 

"There's raw talent there and sophis¬ 
ticated talent there," Mr. Thurman says 
confidently of the College's undergrad¬ 
uates from his current perch as dean of 
students at Wilmington College in 
Ohio. "But it's a self-concept problem. 
They don't think of themselves as the 
tops in the country." He acknowledges, 
"It takes a good deal of presentation 
and forethought [to prepare for the 
Rhodes]. And I don't think Columbia 
has the sort of organized effort that 
places like Harvard has, which recruits 
people very early and stays with them 


on a revised Saints Alive. According to 
the Columbian of 1942, "it exceeded 
expectations, in fact, it was one swell 
show. Most opinions were divided on 
the question of the superiority of Dia¬ 
mond V. the Trilogy [sic], but there was 
none who really did not like the Show." 

A principal reason for its success was 
the hilarious Groucho Marxian perfor¬ 
mance of Jester editor Gerry Green '42 as 
Penrod, one of the two saints who come 
down from heaven to raise hell on the 
Morningside campus. He and Matty 
Rosenschein '42 as Sam, the other saint, 
sang "Harem in Heaven," (my lyrics, 
music by Al Sherwin '42). The Columbian 
called it "the best number," especially 
since it was accompanied by "bumps 
and a wonderful snake dance by the 
members of the Pony Ballet." It ended 
with a memorable rhyme: 

When they see our gals in tunics. 

They'll apply for jobs as eunuchs 
In our harem in heaven!

a 


all the way through. We have to try 
harder to be like Harvard—which is 
unfortunate, because Columbia has a 
better undergraduate education." 

Students whose attempts to apply for 
the Rhodes have been frustrated by an 
understaffed Dean of Students' office 
tend to agree. Still, several Scholars have 
emerged in the last few years, among 
them Barbara Petzen '87, Eric Garcetti 
'92, and Katharine Chubbuck '93, as 
well as Mr. Radtke and Mr. Marci. But 
candidates are warned that even at 
Oxford, all good things come to an end: 
"Once you graduate, the spell is bro¬ 
ken," Mr. Rudman says. "You can never 
go back through the looking glass." q

SENSE OF EVIL 


Columbia College Today 


Sense of evil 

(continued from page 17) 

Masai and remain true to our principle 
of refraining from comparative cultural 
judgments would be 

if the Masai peoples eventually die off 
amid the economic, political, and eco¬ 
logical transformation of East Africa. 
[Then] we could, on ethnocentric prin¬ 
ciples, rescue that last surviving Masai 
woman as she crawls starving across 
the Ogaden. The price of her emanci¬ 
pation would then be the death of her 
culture, which we are restrained from 
countenancing by our principled anti- 
universalism and our healthy suspi¬ 
cion of Western imperialism. 

In other words, to make a judgment 
and save a life is to suspend one's irony 
about one's own culture. It is to repudi¬ 
ate someone else's belief on behalf of 
one's own. This has become an increas¬ 
ingly difficult act to imagine, much less 
perform, since as a society we seem to 
have virtually no beliefs left. When we 
use the old words—rights, responsibili¬ 
ty, and above all, evil—we are reverting 
to a world that the new ironist believes 
he has left behind. 

One of the best descriptions of this 
kind of paralysis has been offered in a 
remarkable book by Richard Rorty 
called Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity 
(1989). It is, like The Last Gentleman, a 
reprise of Walter Lippmann, and a 
reminder of how much contemporary 
America resembles the America between 
the wars about which Lippmann was 


writing. Rorty's own concession to irony 
is to substitute the feminine pronoun for 
what was, until recently, the unexam¬ 
ined universal he: 

The ironist spends her time worrying 
about the possibility that she has been 
initiated into the wrong tribe, taught 
to play the wrong language game. She 
worries that the process of socializa¬ 
tion which turned her into a human 
being by giving her a language may 
have given her the wrong language, 
and so turned her into the wrong kind 
of human being. But she cannot give a 
criterion of wrongness. So, the more 
she is driven to articulate her situation 
in philosophical terms, the more she 
reminds herself of her rootlessness. 

Most Americans today recognize the 
feeling of rootlessness that Rorty 
describes here and know all too well 
what it means to live without a "criteri¬ 
on of wrongness." We recognize it 
because it is a description of where, and 
who, we are. 


I t is now customary to think of 

"consciousness," in the words of 
the critic Fredric Jameson, as "a 
kind of construction rather than a 
stable substance... a locus of rela¬ 
tionships rather than an ego in the older 
sense." Within the covers of an academic 
book, this "postmodernist" view of con¬ 
sciousness is a harmless abstraction, a 
way of asserting that the self is authored 
by the world rather than the other way 
around, as certain literary critics like to 
say. The cardinal principle of this post¬ 
modernist irony is that it is unintelligible 
to talk about the self before the advent of 
language: that the self is merely the 
name given to the stream of instincts, 
reflexes, and attitudes that are tunneled 
into a human organism by the history of 
its antecedents. 

But when this theory or idea gets loose 
from the books, it becomes another mat¬ 
ter altogether. For it is a way of thinking 
about the self that is incompatible with 
personal responsibility. In this sense, the 
most articulate ironists of the last few 
years have not been professors but killers 
like the Menendez brothers—persons 
who variously identify some compulsion 
originating outside themselves as the ini¬ 
tiator of their actions. "The architecture of 


"Wish me luck. I got a raw deal," says one 
embittered woman in The Big Sleep. 
Bogart, as Philip Marlowe, replies: "Your 
kind always does." 



[their] self-defense," as Elizabeth Hard¬ 
wick has put it, is always organized 
around some form of coercion, and the 
most common form of coercion is sexual 
abuse ("as pertinent to the therapist," 
Hardwick says, "as a kidney to the urolo¬ 
gist")—a form of terror that, as the young 
Lyle Menendez expressed it on the wit¬ 
ness stand, left him "no choice but to kill 
his parents." In the case of Lorena Bob¬ 
bitt, who cut off her abusive husband's 
penis, it was "the weapon of her tor¬ 
ture—that is, her abusive husband's 
penis," which she identified as the source 
of her misery and which she attacked 
with the kitchen knife. 

Intended to exonerate, these are only 
two of the better-known in a rash of 
responsibility-evading claims that come 
spewing forth from criminal defendants 
in America today. The question of where 
responsibility lies for the perpetration of 
evil is, of course, an ancient one; but the 
brazenness of these disavowals is new, 
and it is one of the most striking features 
of contemporary culture—a mutant form 
of irony, but a form nevertheless. In an 
essay that argues for Richard Nixon as the 
single greatest influence on contemporary 
American literature, the novelist Charles 
Baxter has called this trend "the concept 
of deniability," or "the almost complete 
disavowal of intention in relation to bad 
consequences." Not long ago a book was 
pubhshed about Adolf Hitler's childhood 
in which the argument was advanced 
that "the life of [this] mass murderer 
reflects the countless murders to which 
the child was subjected." 

The line between explanation and 
excuse is always a thin one, and many 
scrupulous people have tried hard to 
locate it precisely in order not to cross 
it; but the question of where to draw 
this line has never been so resistant to 
an answer as it is now. One looks back 
wistfully to the singular historical 
moment when the theologian Reinhold 
Niebuhr, in a book entitled The Nature 
and Destiny of Man (can one imagine 
any academic luminary today affiliating 
himself with such a title?), wrote of 
"responsibility despite inevitability": 

While all particular sins have both 
social sources and social conse¬ 
quences, the real essence of sin can be 
understood only in the vertical 
dimension of the soul's relation to 
God because the freedom of the self 
stands outside all relations, and there¬ 
fore has no other judge but God. It is 
for this reason that a profound insight 
into the character of sin must lead to 










SENSE OE EVIL / STEPH ANOPOULOS

the confession, "Against thee, thee 
only, have I sinned, and done this evil 
in thy sight" (Psalms, 51). 

It was with this same structure of 
responsibility in mind that Telford Tay¬ 
lor insisted at the Nuremberg trials that 
"it is important that the trial not become 
an inquiry into the causes of the war," 
that there should be no "effort or time 
spent on apportioning out responsibility 
for causing the war among the many 
nations and individuals concerned.... 
Contributing causes may be pleaded by 
the defendants before the bar of history, 
but not before the tribunal." Justice 
Robert Jackson, the American prosecu¬ 
tor at Nuremberg, opened the case 
against the Nazi defendants with the 
statement that "the wrongs which we 
seek to condemn and punish have been 
so calculated, so malignant, and so dev¬ 
astating, that civilization cannot afford 
their being ignored, because it cannot 
survive their being repeated." 

The world of Niebuhr, Taylor, and 
Jackson is lost to us. Today, we live 


instead in the world that the theologian 
Jonathan Edwards predicted, where it is 
no longer clear whether "anybody [is] to 
be either blamed or commended for any¬ 
thing." As Michael Wood has written, it 
is a world 

full of uncaused events, littered with 
things that are just one of those things. 

We are all wrongly accused. We live 
inside a curious, sentimental reversal 
of Kafka's Trial, where the court is 
always found to be stacked and guilty- 
We have been lynched by life. 

This is an unimprovable description of 
the ironic reversals and claims of victim¬ 
ization (the main fare of Oprah Winfrey, 
Phil Donahue, and other impresarios of 
the professional victim) that now char¬ 
acterize American culture, a parodic reit¬ 
eration of Benjamin Franklin's claim that 
for a "creature... able to do only such 
things as God [or fate, or circumstance] 
would have him to do... there can be no 
Merit nor Demerit." Wood then turns to 
one of the most familiar citizens of the 
cinematic version of our world, and 


reminds us of how he responds to one 
of its self-proclaimed victims who 
speaks in this self-excusing way: 

"Wish me luck, 1 got a raw deal," a 
tough, embittered woman says in The 
Big Sleep. Bogart, as Philip Marlowe, 
wiser and stricter and meaner than a 
problem movie, replies, "Your kind 
always does." 

Here is the essential point. Bogart, 
whose crushed hat and trench coat now 
constitute the inventory of upscale 
chain stores, and whose stubble and 
tough talk we like to imitate, possessed 
all the superficial attributes of irony— 
worldliness, fatigue with the self-right¬ 
eous and the prissy and the prudish. He 
had seen it all, had had it all, had 
betrayed and been betrayed. But in the 
end, in the archetypal American film 
Casablanca (in which, as Wood says, he 
hides his "passionate altruism behind a 
mask of selfishness and diffidence"), he 
reveals himself to be an incorruptible 
moralist. Having lost Bogart's sub- 



Stephanopoulos 

(continued from page 19) 

Here's a question that requires you to be a 
little arrogant—and we will make clear 
somehow that we are requiring you to do 
this. [GS laughs] You're in situations where 
you have to get something across in 30 sec¬ 
onds to the President of the United States, 
and it's terribly important, and you must 
have enough self-awareness to know exactly 
what it is you have to offer in there. What 
are the most valuable qualities and abilities 
and experiences that you bring to the table? 
What do you feel most confident about? 

You're right, it's an impossible question 
to answer. All I can see is the print of 
my answer, and I do not like what I see. 

I hope what Tm valued for is a certain 
basic common sense and good judg¬ 
ment. I think that I have a pretty good 
sense generally of how things are going 
to play out a few steps down the road. 
Not always perfectly—you can't know 
perfectly by any means—^but because 
I've done several different jobs in politi¬ 
cal work, policy work, and press, and 
Congress, understanding how all those 
institutions are going to interact, I think, 
is something that I at least think about a 
lot and try to give my advice on. The 
President is the man with the vision and 
the long-term strategy, but I think I'm a 
pretty good day-to-day tactician, and 


getting awfully good over the last four 
years at responding to crises. 

We were talking earlier about the negativi¬ 
ty and the disheartening things about the 
relationship of government to people, but I 
think from where you sit it must also be 
true that an awful lot of positive energy 
comes your way, and that you have, along 
with the President and his immediate circle, 
a unique perspective on this nation's 
promise: You see the best of America. Could 
you speak to that? Is that something that is 
inspiring, or am I just making this up? 

No, absolutely, no, no, it's definitely out 
there, even in the midst of the worst 
tragedies that we've seen, like the Okla¬ 
homa City bombing—to see up close the 


way not only that community pulled 
together, but the stories of firefighters in 
Maryland putting on their gear and get¬ 
ting on airplanes, and having the airlines 
waving them through, not even asking 
for a ticket, and then all going to Okla¬ 
homa City to pull together and try to 
pull off a gargantuan feat of rescue and 
recovery is inspiring. And just to have 
the chance to meet people every single 
day who are out there doing their best to 
help their community, or move an idea 
along, or struggle against incredible 
adversity, whether it's disease or poverty 
or whatever, is inspiring. I guess one of 
the great privileges of working here is 
having that kind of exposure to the true 
wealth of the country.
