# Advice to Myself

To an entering freshman who did not grow up in New York City, I would strongly advise him/her to set aside one evening a week and one Saturday or Sunday a month to explore Manhattan. A Sunday New York Times should be required reading, to accurately keep abreast of the goings-on in the City and in the world. Doing so will remind him/her that there is a world out there, one for which he is being prepared by the College, thus lending a great deal of relevence to his course of study.
