# Best Teacher

While I never had a bad teacher at Columbia, and had many whom I very much enjoyed, I would have to say the best were Jacob Taubes,  whom I had in Humanities A, and Prof. Sokol, who taught a German literature course.  Both created an atmosphere of intellectual stimulation which I appreciated, as it was just what I had come to Columbia hoping for.  They had classroom discussions which expanded one's mind and reasoning ability.
